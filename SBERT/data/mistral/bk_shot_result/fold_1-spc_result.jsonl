The lack of these transportation options may also contribute to the negative state of the urban area by increasing reliance on personal vehicles and worsening urban sprawl.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "phrase", "'", "it", "is", "not", "possible", "'", "indicates", "a", "limitation", "or", "obst", "acle", "that", "cannot", "be", "overcome", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "text", "ment", "ions", "that", "due", "to", "ge", "ographical", "and", "ge", "o", "-", "techn", "ical", "limitations", ",", "it", "is", "not", "possible", "to", "construct", "bus", "rapid", "transit", "systems", ",", "mon", "or", "ails", ",", "or", "met", "ro", "in", "the", "city", ".", "This", "is", "a", "negative", "outcome", "as", "it", "means", "that", "the", "city", "will", "not", "be", "able", "to", "benefit", "from", "these", "sustainable", "transportation", "methods", ",", "which", "are", "crucial", "for", "reducing", "carbon", "emissions", ",", "creating", "safer", ",", "health", "ier", "communities", ",", "and", "supporting", "various", "government", "policies", ".", "The", "lack", "of", "these", "transportation", "options", "may", "also", "contribute", "to", "the", "negative", "state", "of", "the", "urban", "area", "by", "increasing", "rel", "iance", "on", "personal", "vehicles", "and", "w", "ors", "ening", "urban", "spraw", "l", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7417899370193481, 0.8724714517593384, 0.9999991655349731, 0.677039384841919, 0.6441583037376404, 0.9927757382392883, 0.9999591112136841, 0.9999904632568359, 0.9975581169128418, 0.874374270439148, 0.7639514803886414, 0.516207754611969, 0.7958412766456604, 0.9998232126235962, 0.9995101690292358, 0.9999991655349731, 0.999988853931427, 0.9985145330429077, 0.3059096336364746, 0.47817957401275635, 0.7574244737625122, 0.862267255783081, 0.31849318742752075, 0.9963974952697754, 0.33323490619659424, 0.7674552202224731, 0.9999279379844666, 0.9569696187973022, 0.5764948725700378, 0.686582624912262, 0.8307129740715027, 0.9035363793373108, 0.9986392855644226, 0.5192344188690186, 0.24741840362548828, 0.3803175389766693, 0.9999996423721313, 0.5900452136993408, 0.8035237789154053, 0.999991774559021, 0.7921809554100037, 0.9988556504249573, 0.9998912215232849, 0.9984628558158875, 0.5304604172706604, 0.620735228061676, 0.9997656941413879, 0.9999743700027466, 0.9518367052078247, 0.9857071042060852, 0.8033584356307983, 0.7678694128990173, 0.9541044235229492, 0.8169549107551575, 0.9999223351478577, 0.9951412677764893, 0.5431668758392334, 0.9993873238563538, 0.999915599822998, 0.9960202574729919, 0.8513830304145813, 0.9991404414176941, 0.999988853931427, 0.9796658158302307, 0.9840434193611145, 0.9795825481414795, 0.99940425157547, 0.4999832510948181, 0.8413667678833008, 0.8759362697601318, 0.9992619156837463, 0.9053398966789246, 0.5303541421890259, 0.18722879886627197, 0.8608806133270264, 0.7368965148925781, 0.5512902736663818, 0.4926362931728363, 0.3503594696521759, 0.1946963369846344, 0.8433840870857239, 0.6226591467857361, 0.8525411486625671, 0.604315459728241, 0.7326511740684509, 0.701119065284729, 0.9227502942085266, 0.9999902844429016, 0.5248402953147888, 0.9999299645423889, 0.6840360760688782, 0.5904828906059265, 0.9409968852996826, 0.89748615026474, 0.7102599740028381, 0.9300879240036011, 0.4692276120185852, 0.2927331030368805, 0.6575786471366882, 0.846312940120697, 0.9964809417724609, 0.9999881386756897, 0.5311510562896729, 0.8287463188171387, 0.9175691604614258, 0.5876302719116211, 0.9873527884483337, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9996353983879089, 0.9656333327293396, 0.9989906549453735, 0.8882724642753601, 0.7645753026008606, 0.9964817762374878, 0.9993199706077576, 0.902319610118866, 0.42977362871170044, 0.3174249827861786, 0.9999939799308777, 0.8002916574478149, 0.7263569235801697, 0.6185619235038757, 0.42336422204971313, 0.5375794172286987, 0.8417774438858032, 0.9991825819015503, 0.807625949382782, 0.9209469556808472, 0.9627751708030701, 0.9999846816062927, 0.7309651374816895, 0.9769081473350525, 0.9962670803070068, 0.5791071653366089, 0.7153098583221436, 0.4449986517429352, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999935626983643, 0.5826851725578308, 0.8766586184501648, 0.5902553200721741, 0.19213300943374634, 0.9999805092811584, 0.9999627470970154, 0.5955268740653992, 0.9998434782028198, 0.9999974966049194, 0.5810741186141968, 0.788775622844696]}

Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase 'sued' is negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "word", "'", "s", "ued", "'", "indicates", "that", "a", "legal", "action", "has", "been", "taken", "against", "someone", "or", "something", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "fact", "that", "a", "US", "reg", "ulator", "is", "being", "su", "ed", "suggests", "that", "there", "is", "a", "perceived", "issue", "or", "problem", "with", "the", "way", "they", "have", "handled", "information", "related", "to", "G", "MO", "crops", ".", "Given", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "associated", "with", "the", "widespread", "use", "and", "distribution", "of", "G", "MO", "s", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", ",", "it", "is", "reasonable", "to", "assume", "that", "the", "lawsuit", "is", "related", "to", "concerns", "over", "the", "potential", "harm", "or", "risks", "associated", "with", "these", "crops", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "pol", "arity", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "'", "s", "ued", "'", "is", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.785774827003479, 0.8516520261764526, 0.9999982118606567, 0.7274606823921204, 0.7710801959037781, 0.9940223097801208, 0.9999639987945557, 0.9999929666519165, 0.9988332986831665, 0.8569650053977966, 0.9106386303901672, 0.5652077198028564, 0.9858989119529724, 0.9991843700408936, 0.9978109002113342, 0.9996029138565063, 0.32346686720848083, 0.6355486512184143, 0.5145590305328369, 0.9887147545814514, 0.9475591778755188, 0.9672941565513611, 0.9997292160987854, 0.49944648146629333, 0.9181249737739563, 0.6467338800430298, 0.5966220498085022, 0.954052209854126, 0.9456641674041748, 0.7853557467460632, 0.6209820508956909, 0.832186222076416, 0.9995583295822144, 0.6503651738166809, 0.4152514338493347, 0.9999551773071289, 0.964268684387207, 0.6912005543708801, 0.9972479939460754, 0.9999949336051941, 0.9965797662734985, 0.9993016719818115, 0.9996071457862854, 1.0, 0.46845048666000366, 0.955761730670929, 0.943497896194458, 0.7090292572975159, 0.7994847893714905, 0.47942179441452026, 0.46071764826774597, 0.5545344948768616, 0.41587066650390625, 0.8981634974479675, 0.8459965586662292, 0.606754720211029, 0.8362212777137756, 0.5902842283248901, 0.557683527469635, 0.6564055681228638, 0.7471705079078674, 0.9999990463256836, 0.7014374136924744, 0.9999968409538269, 0.984076201915741, 0.9944489598274231, 0.5701645612716675, 0.9886097311973572, 0.6103174090385437, 0.8226722478866577, 0.5242431163787842, 0.9999865293502808, 0.6682886481285095, 0.8054347038269043, 0.9938432574272156, 0.9811350107192993, 0.9978358149528503, 0.9999970197677612, 0.9970812797546387, 0.9999978542327881, 0.9999251365661621, 0.750472903251648, 0.9247857928276062, 0.9916397929191589, 0.998375415802002, 0.9949882626533508, 0.6153847575187683, 0.8646397590637207, 0.7780476212501526, 0.9999935626983643, 0.8581768870353699, 0.9991806745529175, 0.9663031101226807, 0.3173695504665375, 0.5905995965003967, 0.7658379077911377, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9426745176315308, 0.569448709487915, 0.5385288000106812, 0.9037625789642334, 0.8996197581291199, 0.5951769351959229, 0.5518975853919983, 0.9428832530975342, 0.9999976754188538, 0.9145120978355408, 0.966510534286499, 0.9726507663726807, 0.8556897640228271, 0.9999921321868896, 0.9966679811477661, 0.5960500836372375, 0.9999983906745911, 0.9117411971092224, 0.9316941499710083, 0.6919946670532227, 0.9981094002723694, 0.7688318490982056, 0.9999796152114868, 0.9999305605888367, 0.9999134540557861, 0.9504604339599609, 0.780444324016571, 0.9928348064422607, 0.9908366203308105]}

Therefore, the lack of control by a small amount of carbon dioxide over global temperature does not change the fact that larger amounts of these gases are causing harm.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "phrase", "'", "does", "not", "control", "'", "implies", "a", "lack", "of", "influence", "or", "power", ".", "In", "the", "context", "of", "climate", "change", ",", "the", "absence", "of", "control", "by", "a", "small", "amount", "of", "carbon", "dio", "x", "ide", "over", "global", "temperature", "is", "often", "used", "to", "down", "play", "the", "importance", "of", "reducing", "green", "house", "gas", "emissions", ".", "However", ",", "the", "background", "knowledge", "indicates", "that", "human", "activities", ",", "particularly", "the", "release", "of", "large", "amounts", "of", "carbon", "dio", "x", "ide", "and", "other", "green", "house", "g", "ases", ",", "are", "having", "a", "negative", "impact", "on", "the", "environment", "and", "our", "future", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "lack", "of", "control", "by", "a", "small", "amount", "of", "carbon", "dio", "x", "ide", "over", "global", "temperature", "does", "not", "change", "the", "fact", "that", "larger", "amounts", "of", "these", "g", "ases", "are", "causing", "harm", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7163238525390625, 0.9420843124389648, 0.9999991655349731, 0.7811417579650879, 0.7276654839515686, 0.9968498349189758, 0.9999673366546631, 0.9999957084655762, 0.9987050890922546, 0.8919615149497986, 0.8798529505729675, 0.4811091423034668, 0.9034814834594727, 0.9999555945396423, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9999952912330627, 0.9976288676261902, 0.5970800518989563, 0.571438729763031, 0.9984875917434692, 0.9959187507629395, 0.6694933772087097, 0.9673652052879333, 0.9145311713218689, 0.4313441216945648, 0.8976576924324036, 0.7700001001358032, 0.9967284202575684, 0.9974321126937866, 0.4279611110687256, 0.9955803751945496, 0.7956085801124573, 0.39170363545417786, 0.5635368824005127, 0.9859153628349304, 0.9299162030220032, 0.5051800012588501, 0.7516602277755737, 0.3360438942909241, 0.9961027503013611, 0.9999492764472961, 0.8899888396263123, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999805092811584, 0.9999952912330627, 0.5780381560325623, 0.9443284273147583, 0.9241229891777039, 0.6333447694778442, 0.39218422770500183, 0.5875909328460693, 0.5043341517448425, 0.8982042074203491, 0.9999901056289673, 0.8127243518829346, 0.46521273255348206, 0.9905326962471008, 0.4544472396373749, 0.7185813188552856, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9992013573646545, 0.9999768137931824, 0.9141614437103271, 0.5534209609031677, 0.9999812841415405, 0.8095659613609314, 0.23975908756256104, 0.9496890902519226, 0.3282010555267334, 0.9590726494789124, 0.734575629234314, 0.6763032674789429, 0.8304504752159119, 0.6594655513763428, 0.986801266670227, 0.9837596416473389, 0.999999463558197, 0.756526529788971, 0.9858814477920532, 0.9999976754188538, 0.7379266023635864, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9999948740005493, 1.0, 0.6788931488990784, 0.9947596192359924, 0.9998273849487305, 0.9999957084655762, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9999929666519165, 0.9997639060020447, 0.8589289784431458, 0.7531296610832214, 0.9502736926078796, 0.9700425863265991, 0.9998136758804321, 0.9998610019683838, 0.9999443292617798, 0.999976634979248, 0.9821978211402893, 0.51678466796875, 0.9999886751174927, 0.9588930010795593, 0.6591094136238098, 0.9999870657920837, 0.8548921942710876, 0.5656749606132507, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9985175728797913, 0.9640516638755798, 0.7059548497200012, 0.8300360441207886, 0.999521017074585, 0.9997202157974243, 0.969943106174469, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999973177909851, 0.9999666213989258, 0.6706775426864624, 0.9792674779891968, 0.9980693459510803, 0.7078036069869995, 0.9989750385284424, 0.36841434240341187, 0.9959110617637634, 0.6064863801002502, 0.9999762177467346, 0.7176523804664612, 0.7626039981842041, 0.7844671607017517, 0.9669846296310425, 0.9988176822662354, 0.999991238117218, 0.5089768767356873, 0.548855185508728, 0.6699460744857788, 0.5303688049316406, 0.554340660572052]}

Therefore, while the target phrase itself is positive, it should not be taken as an endorsement of GMOs without further consideration of the context and potential risks.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Pos", "itive", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "larg", "est", "producer", "of", "g", "mo", "'", "is", "a", "positive", "statement", "because", "it", "highlights", "the", "USA", "'", "s", "significant", "role", "in", "producing", "gen", "et", "ically", "modified", "crops", ".", "This", "can", "be", "seen", "as", "a", "potential", "advantage", ",", "as", "G", "MO", "s", "have", "the", "potential", "to", "contribute", "to", "sustain", "ability", "and", "environmental", "ism", ",", "as", "mentioned", "in", "the", "positive", "background", "sentence", ".", "However", ",", "it", "is", "important", "to", "note", "that", "the", "potential", "benefits", "of", "G", "MO", "s", "are", "often", "deb", "ated", ",", "and", "the", "negative", "background", "sentences", "highlight", "concerns", "about", "their", "potential", "health", "risks", "and", "negative", "environmental", "impacts", ".", "Therefore", ",", "while", "the", "target", "phrase", "itself", "is", "positive", ",", "it", "should", "not", "be", "taken", "as", "an", "endorse", "ment", "of", "G", "MO", "s", "without", "further", "consideration", "of", "the", "context", "and", "potential", "risks", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8913556337356567, 0.9528347253799438, 0.9999603629112244, 0.5057660937309265, 0.6732982397079468, 0.9953114986419678, 0.9999659657478333, 0.9999955296516418, 0.9989796280860901, 0.894133448600769, 0.6744514107704163, 0.3511275053024292, 0.9996222257614136, 0.6734387278556824, 0.9994289875030518, 1.0, 0.9999691247940063, 0.9933030009269714, 0.730931282043457, 0.9997104406356812, 0.9946264624595642, 0.20619189739227295, 0.20746880769729614, 0.4374716579914093, 0.5626437664031982, 0.34608152508735657, 0.6613845229148865, 0.2845630347728729, 0.9631966352462769, 0.6310509443283081, 0.9299445152282715, 0.9999757409095764, 0.49772143363952637, 0.8980015516281128, 0.6170364022254944, 0.48920533061027527, 0.877604603767395, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9999992251396179, 0.999736487865448, 0.9575642943382263, 0.7733219265937805, 0.3241630792617798, 0.15631964802742004, 0.9676761627197266, 0.7359174489974976, 0.9886614084243774, 0.41089746356010437, 0.4735580086708069, 0.5929221510887146, 0.4989597201347351, 0.5957760214805603, 0.469499409198761, 0.9999856948852539, 0.9849966168403625, 0.7147073745727539, 0.8845176696777344, 0.9514549374580383, 0.9989098310470581, 0.41444292664527893, 0.9040328860282898, 0.7781485915184021, 0.9999938607215881, 0.7275731563568115, 0.7490035891532898, 0.9935282468795776, 0.4946698546409607, 0.8469908833503723, 0.4724259674549103, 0.9995605945587158, 0.6648638248443604, 0.5378511548042297, 0.9274979829788208, 0.5966812372207642, 0.9584996700286865, 0.32634443044662476, 0.9999690651893616, 0.9707236886024475, 0.4974119961261749, 0.5959336757659912, 0.9992278218269348, 0.589746356010437, 0.9459659457206726, 0.7962160110473633, 0.3731082081794739, 0.5426638126373291, 0.8397181630134583, 0.9958992004394531, 0.9999973177909851, 0.9967108964920044, 0.6395224928855896, 0.44020652770996094, 0.6680347323417664, 0.9999735951423645, 0.5151522755622864, 0.9322212338447571, 0.5382745862007141, 0.6440702676773071, 0.2568974494934082, 0.9838565587997437, 0.35824477672576904, 0.5839293599128723, 0.7876339554786682, 0.5685068964958191, 0.7210597395896912, 0.9009686708450317, 0.9819538593292236, 0.9988033771514893, 0.8730934858322144, 0.9951031804084778, 0.9988232851028442, 0.9918842911720276, 0.3130081593990326, 0.9999873042106628, 0.6785743832588196, 0.8865224123001099, 0.5742802619934082, 0.9911292791366577, 0.8292993903160095, 0.961711049079895, 0.9807709455490112, 0.9967774152755737, 0.8198863863945007, 0.5988408327102661, 0.5603724122047424, 0.9894148707389832, 0.7440765500068665, 0.9777756333351135, 0.5451485514640808, 0.48740777373313904, 1.0, 0.8571714758872986, 0.46803057193756104, 0.9999969005584717, 0.9958074688911438, 0.9908475279808044, 0.640110969543457, 0.8946461081504822, 0.8475162982940674, 0.9126109480857849, 0.46672385931015015, 0.9920079112052917, 0.8510860204696655, 0.3917885422706604, 0.8451710343360901, 0.9808593988418579]}

In this context, the situation refers to the potential use of genetically modified plants to create better carbon sinks and control global weather. The background knowledge suggests that the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can have negative consequences, such as contamination of water and soil, impoverishment of communities, and reinforcement of corporate control over the food system. Given this information, it is reasonable to assume that the missed opportunity referred to in the text was an opportunity to avoid or mitigate these negative consequences by using GMOs in a responsible and sustainable way. Therefore, the classification is 'negative' to reflect the regret and potential negative outcomes associated with the missed opportunity.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n",

The background knowledge supports this classification by mentioning the negative impact of greenhouse gases on the climate and the fact that methane, while potent, has a shorter lifespan in the atmosphere.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Pos", "itive", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "term", "'", "cl", "imate", "positive", "effect", "'", "suggests", "that", "the", "impact", "of", "a", "certain", "action", "or", "event", "is", "beneficial", "for", "the", "climate", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "farmer", "is", "discussing", "the", "potential", "positive", "impact", "of", "reducing", "meth", "ane", "emissions", ".", "M", "eth", "ane", "is", "a", "pot", "ent", "green", "house", "gas", ",", "but", "it", "has", "a", "shorter", "lif", "es", "pan", "in", "the", "atmosphere", "compared", "to", "carbon", "dio", "x", "ide", ".", "Therefore", ",", "reducing", "meth", "ane", "emissions", "can", "contribute", "to", "a", "positive", "impact", "on", "the", "climate", ",", "as", "it", "helps", "to", "mit", "igate", "the", "overall", "green", "house", "effect", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "supports", "this", "classification", "by", "mention", "ing", "the", "negative", "impact", "of", "green", "house", "g", "ases", "on", "the", "climate", "and", "the", "fact", "that", "meth", "ane", ",", "while", "pot", "ent", ",", "has", "a", "shorter", "lif", "es", "pan", "in", "the", "atmosphere", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9551365375518799, 0.9693370461463928, 0.9999379515647888, 0.7828367948532104, 0.5849615335464478, 0.9999839067459106, 0.9999955296516418, 0.999793529510498, 0.7567605376243591, 0.900353193283081, 0.470970094203949, 0.9819889068603516, 0.9995805025100708, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9999849200248718, 0.9947618246078491, 0.9999256134033203, 0.2957296669483185, 0.5007126927375793, 0.5975053310394287, 0.2223030924797058, 0.5702729225158691, 0.47432079911231995, 0.8815373778343201, 0.7954180240631104, 0.9099158048629761, 0.3188363015651703, 0.5467374324798584, 0.8772995471954346, 0.8680710196495056, 0.8568804264068604, 0.8494113683700562, 0.6328566074371338, 0.549244225025177, 0.7668635845184326, 0.7464268803596497, 0.9999104142189026, 0.8743641972541809, 0.4054785668849945, 0.7686481475830078, 0.32532453536987305, 0.9802413582801819, 0.9339144825935364, 0.3885233402252197, 0.6448466181755066, 0.9951279163360596, 0.68621426820755, 0.9614226222038269, 1.0, 0.9992978572845459, 0.4442054331302643, 0.4131814241409302, 0.9999948740005493, 0.9999996423721313, 0.876382052898407, 0.805199384689331, 0.71168452501297, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9991046786308289, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9999894499778748, 0.9155611991882324, 0.8531285524368286, 0.6098023653030396, 0.9567274451255798, 0.9999807476997375, 0.9939331412315369, 0.9968342185020447, 0.9998995065689087, 0.9999896287918091, 0.9785304665565491, 0.999984860420227, 0.9999925494194031, 0.9461504220962524, 0.9999943971633911, 0.9732823967933655, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9999839067459106, 0.9999990463256836, 0.7631885409355164, 0.37974604964256287, 0.9999908208847046, 0.8158957362174988, 0.9922623038291931, 1.0, 0.9999250769615173, 0.6728847622871399, 0.6273550391197205, 0.9895544648170471, 0.9077340960502625, 0.33406785130500793, 0.5503605008125305, 0.9999604225158691, 0.9769963622093201, 0.9979990720748901, 0.40299364924430847, 0.6004847288131714, 0.21056853234767914, 0.4623089134693146, 0.7009819746017456, 0.46166783571243286, 0.9999968409538269, 0.982829213142395, 0.4681154191493988, 0.6691357493400574, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9396002292633057, 0.833322286605835, 0.40202969312667847, 0.6816996335983276, 0.9175580739974976, 0.31687992811203003, 0.9887229800224304, 0.6049711108207703, 0.5024057030677795, 0.2939417362213135, 0.9999996423721313, 0.47732287645339966, 0.6700416803359985, 0.7561160326004028, 0.9966142773628235, 0.932231068611145, 0.9999983906745911, 0.9996640682220459, 0.9999786019325256, 0.8755308389663696, 0.9986729621887207, 0.592660129070282, 0.4326237142086029, 0.7706566452980042, 0.2587957978248596, 0.9999828934669495, 0.9846699833869934, 0.999999463558197, 0.7080607414245605, 0.660673975944519, 0.7321251034736633, 0.9999996423721313, 0.999992311000824, 0.6388412117958069, 0.9956263899803162, 0.9692139029502869, 0.9876962900161743, 0.9999399185180664, 0.9999735951423645, 0.33549100160598755, 0.9984886050224304, 0.9999646544456482, 0.5547770261764526, 0.7904186844825745]}

The use of extreme measures to achieve this goal could exacerbate these negative emotions and potentially lead to negative consequences.

The context of the text is crucial in determining the polarity, and without further information, it's reasonable to assume a negative sentiment based on the given background knowledge.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "(", "Ex", "plan", "ation", "):", "\n", "The", "term", "'", "big", "changes", "'", "can", "be", "perceived", "as", "negative", "because", "changes", ",", "especially", "those", "related", "to", "waste", "management", "and", "environmental", "issues", ",", "can", "often", "bring", "about", "incon", "ven", "ience", ",", "uncertainty", ",", "and", "potential", "negative", "impacts", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "also", "supports", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "it", "highlights", "the", "negative", "consequences", "of", "failing", "to", "prior", "itize", "waste", "management", "and", "the", "negative", "impact", "of", "certain", "technologies", ".", "However", ",", "it", "'", "s", "important", "to", "note", "that", "'", "big", "changes", "'", "can", "also", "be", "positive", ",", "such", "as", "the", "implementation", "of", "new", ",", "more", "efficient", "waste", "management", "systems", "or", "the", "adoption", "of", "renew", "able", "energy", "sources", ".", "The", "context", "of", "the", "text", "is", "crucial", "in", "determining", "the", "pol", "arity", ",", "and", "without", "further", "information", ",", "it", "'", "s", "reasonable", "to", "assume", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "based", "on", "the", "given", "background", "knowledge", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.988760769367218, 0.3496239185333252, 0.9999983906745911, 0.9235525727272034, 0.8592392206192017, 0.9999486207962036, 0.9999926686286926, 0.7041597366333008, 0.5645458102226257, 0.6934138536453247, 0.6074936389923096, 0.9524823427200317, 0.996982753276825, 0.9999422430992126, 0.9983692169189453, 0.3097761273384094, 0.2963026762008667, 0.5250515341758728, 0.722307026386261, 0.8803076148033142, 0.3631571829319, 0.37727612257003784, 0.469555526971817, 0.7196623086929321, 0.5464734435081482, 0.35769084095954895, 0.999987006187439, 0.642454981803894, 0.9686833024024963, 0.49284878373146057, 0.46022891998291016, 0.6675568222999573, 0.9966520071029663, 0.7675669193267822, 0.31763529777526855, 0.5885171890258789, 0.78182452917099, 0.4078490734100342, 0.9999951124191284, 0.9769550561904907, 0.5246893763542175, 0.3964439928531647, 0.9665259718894958, 0.7699459791183472, 0.5261085033416748, 0.5165875554084778, 0.7430904507637024, 0.49908873438835144, 0.5310992002487183, 0.4007504880428314, 0.651772677898407, 0.22407090663909912, 0.4705066978931427, 0.9027693271636963, 0.558578610420227, 0.6192795634269714, 0.7145854830741882, 0.6055141091346741, 0.2856264114379883, 0.34900757670402527, 0.6817072629928589, 0.6039330959320068, 0.8881844878196716, 0.2814076840877533, 0.9995846152305603, 0.878220796585083, 0.9999944567680359, 0.5621164441108704, 0.999599277973175, 0.9722833037376404, 0.48285290598869324, 0.26557502150535583, 0.8430905938148499, 0.998956561088562, 0.5614469647407532, 0.29661843180656433, 0.4334911108016968, 0.5073466897010803, 0.9999657273292542, 0.8721342086791992, 0.6464290618896484, 0.999999463558197, 0.8821189403533936, 0.9999862313270569, 0.9386822581291199, 0.9999464154243469, 0.3475516438484192, 0.9887152910232544, 0.9996732473373413, 0.9999812841415405, 0.9494249224662781, 0.9982035160064697, 0.6470423936843872, 0.8781049847602844, 0.7372048497200012, 0.3637807369232178, 0.9999974966049194, 0.525498628616333, 0.727952778339386, 0.999996542930603, 0.40021592378616333, 0.32019129395484924, 0.7886366248130798, 0.8293784260749817, 0.471105694770813, 0.9875045418739319, 0.9433475732803345, 0.8786633610725403, 0.906309187412262, 0.593217134475708, 0.9999969005584717, 0.4307982325553894, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9983787536621094, 0.6640465259552002, 0.9472333192825317, 0.5837422609329224, 0.4209422469139099, 0.8327688574790955, 0.9997366666793823, 0.7732890844345093, 0.27785420417785645, 0.6230494379997253, 0.7854546308517456, 0.9903486371040344, 0.9934319257736206, 0.35590028762817383, 0.9999974966049194, 0.3926420211791992, 0.8175962567329407, 0.7494450807571411, 0.49129095673561096, 0.7748249173164368, 0.9457032680511475, 0.7579385042190552, 0.8083504438400269, 0.9999997019767761, 0.7544323205947876, 0.9999976754188538, 0.9956479072570801, 0.7891836166381836, 0.9971526861190796, 0.3325027525424957, 0.7696318626403809, 0.99994957447052, 0.9937487244606018, 0.4165551960468292, 0.9280092120170593, 0.9949297904968262, 0.8807072043418884, 0.9916968941688538]}
