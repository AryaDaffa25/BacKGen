However, it is important to note that the absence of evidence for a correlation does not necessarily mean that there is no correlation, and further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between climate change and extreme weather events.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "text", "states", "that", "'", "many", "clim", "ates", "c", "ient", "ists", "note", "there", "is", "not", "even", "evidence", "to", "show", "a", "correlation", "much", "less", "attribute", "climate", "change", "as", "a", "cause", "of", "extreme", "weather", "events", "this", "year", "'.", "This", "implies", "that", "the", "consensus", "among", "climate", "scientists", "is", "that", "there", "is", "not", "enough", "evidence", "to", "link", "climate", "change", "to", "extreme", "weather", "events", "in", "the", "current", "year", ".", "This", "is", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "role", "of", "climate", "change", "in", "extreme", "weather", "events", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "also", "supports", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "it", "highlights", "the", "negative", "consequences", "of", "climate", "change", "and", "the", "urg", "ency", "to", "address", "it", ".", "However", ",", "it", "is", "important", "to", "note", "that", "the", "absence", "of", "evidence", "for", "a", "correlation", "does", "not", "necessarily", "mean", "that", "there", "is", "no", "correlation", ",", "and", "further", "research", "is", "needed", "to", "fully", "understand", "the", "relationship", "between", "climate", "change", "and", "extreme", "weather", "events", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8552408814430237, 0.9333711266517639, 0.9999983310699463, 0.6493072509765625, 0.726568341255188, 0.9930458664894104, 0.999962568283081, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9967787861824036, 0.851808488368988, 0.8612563610076904, 0.2514577805995941, 0.5322755575180054, 0.9864512085914612, 0.381928414106369, 0.9258089065551758, 0.9910385608673096, 0.7772815227508545, 0.9978435635566711, 0.9998575448989868, 0.9999769926071167, 0.7268916964530945, 0.9818102121353149, 0.9996770024299622, 0.9998220801353455, 0.9995831251144409, 0.999997079372406, 0.9946999549865723, 0.9999670386314392, 0.999904453754425, 0.999829113483429, 0.9474383592605591, 0.9999874830245972, 0.9985861778259277, 0.9995792508125305, 0.9398253560066223, 0.9908013939857483, 0.9998947381973267, 0.9999825358390808, 0.9932729005813599, 0.9999608993530273, 0.999999463558197, 0.9999875426292419, 0.9763267040252686, 0.9999925494194031, 0.5529167056083679, 0.844828188419342, 0.3852415680885315, 0.7559493184089661, 0.519754946231842, 0.1879609078168869, 0.9211223721504211, 0.608812689781189, 0.9997947812080383, 0.8524050116539001, 0.8841153383255005, 0.6426783204078674, 0.9521033763885498, 0.3981524705886841, 0.5366533398628235, 0.9643392562866211, 0.8676015734672546, 0.4116341769695282, 0.9367941617965698, 0.9998347163200378, 0.5341716408729553, 0.891288161277771, 0.9999768733978271, 0.9896969795227051, 0.17082805931568146, 0.8673710823059082, 0.7811943292617798, 0.9951803684234619, 0.8302983045578003, 0.42108234763145447, 0.1981506645679474, 0.7272657752037048, 0.9213058352470398, 0.43725916743278503, 0.7081877589225769, 0.8877882361412048, 0.3410288691520691, 0.8348562121391296, 0.999955952167511, 0.9999287724494934, 0.9148299098014832, 0.808986246585846, 0.9998733401298523, 0.8821216821670532, 0.4391026496887207, 0.35919666290283203, 0.628029465675354, 0.9510555267333984, 0.4753728210926056, 0.4782668948173523, 0.7637758255004883, 0.26460301876068115, 0.49260106682777405, 0.923887312412262, 0.8587800860404968, 0.1636480838060379, 0.8848575353622437, 0.6657370924949646, 0.3807644844055176, 0.6961639523506165, 0.9943033456802368, 0.9999886155128479, 0.6939571499824524, 0.8991970419883728, 0.22586467862129211, 0.9999734163284302, 0.548955500125885, 0.9265138506889343, 0.8127215504646301, 0.7737972736358643, 0.38878950476646423, 0.9998133778572083, 0.5030189752578735, 0.38803035020828247, 0.9504707455635071, 0.9997125864028931, 0.9251567125320435, 0.9990806579589844, 0.5710452198982239, 0.5178856253623962, 0.999437153339386, 0.5669469833374023, 0.561524510383606, 0.9888761639595032, 0.6698986291885376, 0.5341398119926453, 0.9999839663505554, 0.4741842448711395, 0.7940707802772522, 0.9538192749023438, 0.7249418497085571, 0.987487256526947, 0.9990481734275818, 0.8274170756340027, 0.5977489352226257, 0.39019322395324707, 0.5837417244911194, 0.9652369022369385, 0.9074847102165222, 0.6522709131240845, 0.909848690032959, 0.22175556421279907, 0.9919899106025696, 0.9239200949668884, 0.9800034761428833, 0.9875516891479492, 0.9955238699913025, 0.999988317489624, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9977974891662598, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9997332096099854, 0.9998692870140076, 0.9521644711494446]}

For instance, if the US prioritizes the use of cleaner and more efficient natural gas extraction methods and invests in carbon capture and storage technologies, the positive outcomes of leading in LNG exports could outweigh the negative ones. Conversely, if the US continues to prioritize short-term gains and neglects the long-term consequences, the negative impacts could dominate.

The negative sentiment associated with the background knowledge further supports the classification of the target phrase as negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "term", "'", "un", "author", "ised", "enc", "ro", "achment", "'", "refers", "to", "the", "act", "of", "occup", "ying", "or", "using", "public", "property", "without", "proper", "author", "ization", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "enc", "ro", "achment", "is", "taking", "place", "in", "a", "green", "park", "society", ",", "which", "is", "a", "public", "space", "intended", "for", "the", "enjoy", "ment", "and", "use", "of", "all", "residents", ".", "The", "presence", "of", "un", "author", "ised", "structures", ",", "such", "as", "gar", "ages", ",", "on", "these", "government", "foot", "paths", "and", "roads", "is", "a", "violation", "of", "the", "rules", "and", "regulations", "governing", "the", "use", "of", "these", "areas", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "indicates", "that", "neglect", "and", "poor", "management", "of", "public", "spaces", "are", "significant", "issues", ",", "and", "the", "failure", "to", "address", "un", "author", "ised", "enc", "ro", "ach", "ments", "cont", "ributes", "to", "these", "problems", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "associated", "with", "the", "background", "knowledge", "further", "supports", "the", "classification", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "as", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.791661262512207, 0.9315613508224487, 0.9999986290931702, 0.7075971961021423, 0.5855327844619751, 0.9935635328292847, 0.9999755620956421, 0.9999951124191284, 0.9979919791221619, 0.8272063136100769, 0.8303484916687012, 0.41078343987464905, 0.9795495867729187, 0.9902726411819458, 0.9706716537475586, 0.999999463558197, 0.999988317489624, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999677538871765, 0.9996530413627625, 0.39603981375694275, 0.9999685883522034, 0.8004751205444336, 0.23993107676506042, 0.9997933506965637, 0.8124657869338989, 0.9999939203262329, 0.8319223523139954, 0.8555452823638916, 0.2633377015590668, 0.47413232922554016, 0.8841052055358887, 0.7983714938163757, 0.6685639023780823, 0.8175655603408813, 0.7466884255409241, 0.5849692225456238, 0.6205641627311707, 0.8124319314956665, 0.9995371699333191, 0.5220383405685425, 0.45006823539733887, 0.9999961853027344, 0.9889193773269653, 0.36597657203674316, 0.4495078921318054, 0.9999933838844299, 0.9330777525901794, 0.8480571508407593, 0.5369701981544495, 0.9800650477409363, 0.9950301647186279, 0.7804879546165466, 0.7171111702919006, 0.2781619131565094, 0.4409946799278259, 0.7146173715591431, 0.7612916231155396, 0.5389286875724792, 0.9978522658348083, 0.8262673020362854, 0.519859790802002, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9274735450744629, 0.6086602210998535, 0.9947755336761475, 0.7198995351791382, 0.4516546428203583, 0.9780926704406738, 0.8793728351593018, 0.24071934819221497, 0.9999035596847534, 0.7800261378288269, 0.4990820586681366, 0.9999852776527405, 0.8796406984329224, 0.42979779839515686, 0.9326321482658386, 0.9999969005584717, 0.8644380569458008, 1.0, 0.9287996292114258, 0.6055381298065186, 0.5708440542221069, 0.21652883291244507, 0.8845878839492798, 0.9987867474555969, 0.24460412561893463, 0.8751031756401062, 0.22086825966835022, 0.8037617802619934, 0.6800993084907532, 0.9937667846679688, 0.5952416658401489, 0.786037802696228, 0.9201673269271851, 0.6942060589790344, 0.35778069496154785, 0.5415147542953491, 0.8988409638404846, 0.9999247193336487, 0.8558297157287598, 0.8677897453308105, 0.9789369702339172, 0.5205075144767761, 0.3134964406490326, 0.9007065296173096, 0.22457683086395264, 0.8747663497924805, 0.4202836751937866, 0.7800450921058655, 0.883944034576416, 0.9997223019599915, 0.48835134506225586, 0.9976049661636353, 0.9122555255889893, 0.29567182064056396, 0.588292121887207, 0.5883058905601501, 0.47231370210647583, 0.2768383324146271, 0.8120899796485901, 0.8117884993553162, 0.6512060165405273, 0.9415984749794006, 0.43646571040153503, 0.9858014583587646, 0.9999939799308777, 0.998216450214386, 0.9999969005584717, 0.6512125134468079, 0.9999989867210388, 0.5198162794113159, 0.9999874830245972, 0.9530409574508667, 0.4316062331199646, 0.9963258504867554, 0.9637613296508789, 0.2514279782772064, 0.5716317892074585, 0.9300852417945862, 0.43970343470573425, 0.9999944567680359, 0.7236616611480713, 0.9757285714149475, 0.824388861656189, 0.39755454659461975, 0.745133101940155, 0.9178900718688965, 0.9718696475028992, 0.9932486414909363, 0.4816617965698242, 0.8434682488441467, 0.9982672333717346, 0.9966691136360168, 0.6023277640342712, 0.9920676350593567, 0.9823511838912964]}

The negative sentiment towards Bill Gates and his practices, as well as the potential negative connotations associated with mandatory vaccination programs, contribute to the overall negative polarity of the target phrase.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "v", "acc", "inate", "us", "from", "cr", "ad", "le", "to", "grave", "block", "out", "the", "'", "is", "negative", "in", "context", "due", "to", "the", "surrounding", "sentiment", "in", "the", "text", ".", "The", "text", "express", "es", "a", "negative", "view", "towards", "Bill", "G", "ates", "and", "his", "involvement", "in", "various", "controversial", "practices", ",", "such", "as", "promoting", "gen", "et", "ically", "modified", "organ", "isms", "(", "G", "MO", "s", ")", "and", "synthetic", "food", "sources", ".", "The", "phrase", "'", "v", "acc", "inate", "us", "from", "cr", "ad", "le", "to", "grave", "'", "is", "often", "used", "to", "critic", "ize", "mandatory", "vacc", "ination", "programs", ",", "which", "can", "be", "perceived", "as", "an", "inf", "ring", "ement", "on", "personal", "freedom", "and", "aut", "onomy", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "Bill", "G", "ates", "and", "his", "practices", ",", "as", "well", "as", "the", "potential", "negative", "con", "notations", "associated", "with", "mandatory", "vacc", "ination", "programs", ",", "contribute", "to", "the", "overall", "negative", "pol", "arity", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.6827860474586487, 0.9644806981086731, 0.9999986886978149, 0.7147745490074158, 0.4941571354866028, 0.9950546622276306, 0.9999651312828064, 0.9999865889549255, 0.9957419037818909, 0.8721725940704346, 0.8477181196212769, 0.5368636846542358, 0.9997004270553589, 0.48720189929008484, 0.9999339580535889, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9998992681503296, 0.9999639987945557, 0.9999873042106628, 0.9999861717224121, 0.9999974966049194, 1.0, 0.999999463558197, 0.9994317293167114, 0.8665669560432434, 0.9999755024909973, 0.7302036881446838, 0.6499729156494141, 0.2886488437652588, 0.3308784067630768, 0.47345757484436035, 0.727988064289093, 0.2576720714569092, 0.9997268915176392, 0.9733198881149292, 0.271915465593338, 0.3361211121082306, 0.17041988670825958, 0.9992821216583252, 0.787049412727356, 0.6071262359619141, 0.9253225326538086, 0.5883359909057617, 0.545954704284668, 0.9997716546058655, 0.37607887387275696, 0.7822126746177673, 0.5686262845993042, 0.7304161787033081, 0.9288625717163086, 0.9999218583106995, 0.9999989867210388, 0.44758158922195435, 0.9748514890670776, 0.30988767743110657, 0.7770501375198364, 0.2627808153629303, 0.2388099879026413, 0.2884761691093445, 0.7261379361152649, 0.49648240208625793, 0.9999709725379944, 0.4923684597015381, 0.4517437517642975, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9999905228614807, 0.9995207190513611, 0.5557723641395569, 0.9998592734336853, 0.5225706100463867, 0.9994085431098938, 0.9999751448631287, 0.9985758066177368, 0.776368260383606, 0.9948464632034302, 0.7271829843521118, 0.968887209892273, 0.9703112840652466, 0.6071670055389404, 0.6558924317359924, 0.3060494363307953, 0.9679214358329773, 0.9602351188659668, 0.999999463558197, 0.999668538570404, 0.9986844062805176, 0.995361328125, 0.9999772906303406, 0.9999992251396179, 1.0, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9992325901985168, 0.9772903323173523, 0.4237675964832306, 0.4641962945461273, 0.6629852652549744, 0.28832051157951355, 0.523357093334198, 0.9986703395843506, 0.7347292900085449, 0.7951763272285461, 0.9764189720153809, 0.8369719386100769, 0.43011945486068726, 0.5369006395339966, 0.6504723429679871, 0.7472439408302307, 0.5017482042312622, 0.9846165776252747, 0.6123844981193542, 0.4915945827960968, 0.999896228313446, 0.9999949336051941, 0.6037156581878662, 0.8492911458015442, 0.48588037490844727, 0.8360617160797119, 0.7180030941963196, 0.999999463558197, 0.9651722311973572, 0.3836708664894104, 0.12506642937660217, 0.9246826171875, 0.9094511866569519, 0.6194015145301819, 0.9999790787696838, 0.9999951124191284, 0.7812097072601318, 0.5452761054039001, 0.42231184244155884, 0.3708800673484802, 0.3687206208705902, 0.9248691201210022, 0.9999781250953674, 0.9992870688438416, 0.29504865407943726, 0.3221331834793091, 0.2795701324939728, 0.6224554777145386, 0.526961088180542, 0.9999974966049194, 0.5497390031814575, 0.9995489716529846, 0.8662537932395935, 0.5912981033325195, 0.9985254406929016, 0.8167734742164612, 0.9998927712440491, 0.9886433482170105, 0.7702193260192871, 0.9759014844894409, 0.6888295412063599, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9971083402633667, 0.9840194582939148, 0.9842809438705444, 0.9999004006385803, 0.9670249223709106, 0.9172280430793762]}

Additionally, the fact that amino acid biostimulants will become increasingly important to maintain crop outputs suggests that the current methods are insufficient, further emphasizing the negative situation.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "water", "scarc", "ity", "predicted", "to", "w", "ors", "en", "in", "more", "than", "", "8", "0", "of", "cro", "pl", "ands", "glob", "ally", "this", "century", "'", "indicates", "a", "negative", "situation", ",", "as", "water", "scarc", "ity", "is", "a", "problem", "that", "can", "lead", "to", "food", "in", "security", ",", "economic", "inst", "ability", ",", "and", "social", "un", "rest", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "also", "supports", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "it", "highlights", "the", "negative", "impact", "of", "current", "agricultural", "practices", "and", "water", "distribution", "systems", "on", "communities", ",", "particularly", "marginal", "ized", "groups", ".", "Additionally", ",", "the", "fact", "that", "am", "ino", "acid", "bi", "ost", "im", "ul", "ants", "will", "become", "increasingly", "important", "to", "maintain", "crop", "outputs", "suggests", "that", "the", "current", "methods", "are", "ins", "ufficient", ",", "further", "emphas", "izing", "the", "negative", "situation", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7842437624931335, 0.8302863836288452, 0.9999987483024597, 0.6773713827133179, 0.7200716733932495, 0.9928715229034424, 0.9999659657478333, 0.9999962449073792, 0.9967566728591919, 0.8369117379188538, 0.911353349685669, 0.3656609356403351, 0.9994063973426819, 0.3472481667995453, 0.999599814414978, 0.999996542930603, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9998501539230347, 0.9999970197677612, 0.9999999403953552, 0.999999463558197, 1.0, 0.9726488590240479, 0.9999707341194153, 0.9999920725822449, 0.9999995231628418, 0.999999463558197, 1.0, 0.999909520149231, 0.9999503493309021, 1.0, 0.9999978542327881, 0.9998970031738281, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9994931817054749, 0.9999243021011353, 0.9988675713539124, 0.3958318531513214, 0.6689382791519165, 0.4860231876373291, 0.7716119289398193, 0.34731099009513855, 0.7371523976325989, 0.5317069888114929, 0.9990540742874146, 0.9999969005584717, 0.4674903154373169, 0.39141544699668884, 0.4967298209667206, 0.8552666306495667, 0.8295294046401978, 0.5416013598442078, 0.9999933838844299, 0.7876194715499878, 0.8101435303688049, 0.9999209642410278, 0.6783210635185242, 0.24105386435985565, 0.9566028714179993, 0.9999474883079529, 0.986869752407074, 0.9940193295478821, 0.20668774843215942, 0.8022947311401367, 0.9999828934669495, 0.9031575322151184, 0.5213200449943542, 0.4529639780521393, 0.902890682220459, 0.5816984176635742, 0.40063193440437317, 0.7725949287414551, 0.879784882068634, 0.6673737168312073, 0.8183993697166443, 0.8069543242454529, 0.4220145344734192, 0.6572353839874268, 0.6196684241294861, 0.4866509437561035, 0.9935782551765442, 0.7385936975479126, 0.9983696341514587, 0.9996698498725891, 0.9072623252868652, 0.963715672492981, 0.998404324054718, 0.9981919527053833, 0.7511107325553894, 0.5735294222831726, 0.8060678839683533, 0.87522292137146, 0.7502889633178711, 0.9999518990516663, 0.9146409034729004, 0.8785006999969482, 0.41527703404426575, 0.9999903440475464, 0.5691158771514893, 0.18748238682746887, 0.9999714493751526, 0.6498987674713135, 0.999914288520813, 0.43107670545578003, 0.9991638660430908, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9999942183494568, 0.9999995231628418, 0.8411605954170227, 0.9942284226417542, 0.9802636504173279, 0.9997575283050537, 0.947899341583252, 0.9995188117027283, 0.5460580587387085, 0.9914575815200806, 0.40597862005233765, 0.8699796795845032, 0.4254147410392761, 0.49512991309165955, 0.550687849521637, 0.7484626770019531, 0.50967937707901, 0.9999960064888, 0.44840216636657715, 0.6748574376106262, 0.8020164966583252, 0.9999474287033081, 0.9994826912879944, 0.5349462628364563, 0.23543895781040192, 0.9928938150405884, 0.9822046160697937]}
