It simply suggests that it may not be sufficient on its own to completely eliminate pollution.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "statement", "'", "techn", "ology", "will", "not", "end", "pollution", "'", "implies", "that", "technology", "is", "unable", "to", "effectively", "address", "or", "solve", "the", "issue", "of", "pollution", ".", "Given", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "associated", "with", "the", "background", "knowledge", "regarding", "the", "negative", "impact", "of", "human", "activities", ",", "including", "the", "use", "of", "technology", ",", "on", "the", "environment", "and", "the", "ext", "inction", "of", "various", "species", ",", "it", "is", "reasonable", "to", "class", "ify", "this", "statement", "as", "negative", ".", "However", ",", "it", "'", "s", "important", "to", "note", "that", "the", "statement", "does", "not", "necessarily", "mean", "that", "technology", "is", "the", "sole", "cause", "of", "pollution", "or", "that", "it", "cannot", "contribute", "to", "solutions", "in", "any", "way", ".", "It", "simply", "suggests", "that", "it", "may", "not", "be", "sufficient", "on", "its", "own", "to", "completely", "eliminate", "pollution", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7790517807006836, 0.9382294416427612, 0.9999990463256836, 0.4930702745914459, 0.6315951347351074, 0.9943751096725464, 0.999964714050293, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9981822371482849, 0.842072069644928, 0.8363019227981567, 0.3862660527229309, 0.744038462638855, 0.9977741241455078, 1.0, 0.999988317489624, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9999966025352478, 0.9999873042106628, 0.9981415271759033, 0.289948433637619, 0.8072256445884705, 0.9175362586975098, 0.9305902719497681, 0.3801882565021515, 0.9626144766807556, 0.5211166739463806, 0.8487222194671631, 0.3556463420391083, 0.39434319734573364, 0.9417487978935242, 0.6484463214874268, 0.9969062805175781, 0.9856468439102173, 0.7464675307273865, 0.5870599150657654, 0.9594582915306091, 0.6333637237548828, 0.8366004228591919, 0.2304186075925827, 0.9999599456787109, 0.7353473901748657, 0.5617475509643555, 0.7507866621017456, 0.36505311727523804, 0.8865887522697449, 0.5549894571304321, 0.929909348487854, 0.9990366697311401, 0.521195650100708, 0.9005513191223145, 0.6394486427307129, 0.8207858800888062, 0.7211033701896667, 0.8969215154647827, 0.9997374415397644, 0.919714093208313, 0.8481764793395996, 0.9694572687149048, 0.9996119141578674, 0.9999555945396423, 0.4994667172431946, 0.9355809688568115, 0.9846954941749573, 0.9999976754188538, 0.9999977350234985, 0.7980279922485352, 0.9999969005584717, 0.9990089535713196, 0.5652304887771606, 0.7390895485877991, 0.7182021737098694, 0.9999040365219116, 0.34615084528923035, 0.9999939203262329, 0.6109579801559448, 0.9232759475708008, 0.9999669790267944, 0.9508162140846252, 0.952569842338562, 0.35067418217658997, 0.9999744296073914, 0.9881447553634644, 0.5242932438850403, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9467931389808655, 0.9999678134918213, 0.9756154417991638, 0.9998007416725159, 0.47834452986717224, 0.41572314500808716, 0.8596401214599609, 0.9999688267707825, 0.6061069965362549, 0.6625415086746216, 0.9908536672592163, 0.7723159193992615, 0.8824349641799927, 0.6844975352287292, 0.7670659422874451, 0.5306677222251892, 0.9770126342773438, 0.9987315535545349, 0.5485029220581055, 0.996265709400177, 0.43188273906707764, 0.6956028342247009, 0.9026492834091187, 0.9551604390144348, 0.42870086431503296, 0.4083583652973175, 0.9704042077064514, 0.9974188804626465, 0.9588693976402283, 0.5718662142753601, 0.6566821932792664, 0.5219260454177856, 0.9947473406791687, 0.5602737665176392, 0.9551166892051697, 0.9995788931846619, 0.9933415651321411, 0.3700720965862274, 0.9165387749671936, 0.9999974966049194, 0.999998152256012, 0.8911793828010559, 0.7099244594573975, 0.36136478185653687, 0.98663729429245, 0.9900977611541748, 0.5405691266059875]}

These stereotypes suggest that those who undergo these processes are being harmed or corrupted, leading to the negative classification for the target phrase.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "term", "'", "t", "ort", "ured", "souls", "'", "carries", "a", "negative", "con", "notation", ",", "imp", "lying", "suffering", "or", "distress", ".", "The", "text", "ment", "ions", "the", "rum", "or", "of", "people", "with", "'", "in", "verted", "features", "'", "being", "tort", "ured", "souls", ",", "which", "is", "likely", "a", "reference", "to", "the", "belief", "that", "those", "with", "traits", "considered", "und", "es", "irable", "or", "un", "natural", "are", "being", "pun", "ished", "or", "mist", "reated", ".", "This", "belief", "is", "fuel", "ed", "by", "the", "negative", "stere", "ot", "ypes", "about", "vacc", "ines", "and", "G", "MO", "s", ",", "as", "mentioned", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", ".", "These", "stere", "ot", "ypes", "suggest", "that", "those", "who", "under", "go", "these", "processes", "are", "being", "har", "med", "or", "cor", "rupted", ",", "leading", "to", "the", "negative", "classification", "for", "the", "target", "phrase", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.758048415184021, 0.9269989132881165, 0.9999989867210388, 0.7380731701850891, 0.7219861149787903, 0.9937820434570312, 0.9999653100967407, 0.9999957084655762, 0.9959762096405029, 0.8286610841751099, 0.8603825569152832, 0.3235495686531067, 0.8806626200675964, 0.9999538660049438, 0.9999552965164185, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999448657035828, 0.999142587184906, 0.22624905407428741, 0.9577248692512512, 0.7747179865837097, 0.8444572687149048, 0.9999770522117615, 0.5991641283035278, 0.3649873733520508, 0.9999957084655762, 0.7206764817237854, 0.49140089750289917, 0.5762453079223633, 0.9832221865653992, 0.7868668437004089, 0.3280414938926697, 0.3473520278930664, 0.9999997019767761, 0.47104600071907043, 0.3700309097766876, 0.9766669869422913, 0.6173086166381836, 0.46694689989089966, 0.4509701430797577, 0.4313875138759613, 0.6249251365661621, 0.9981591701507568, 0.9981706738471985, 0.9809224009513855, 0.7570857405662537, 0.4163770079612732, 0.9999978542327881, 0.9242202043533325, 0.5407759547233582, 0.42535948753356934, 0.4582817852497101, 0.3837120532989502, 0.32387295365333557, 0.7334965467453003, 0.9999552965164185, 0.554700493812561, 0.5445677638053894, 0.9853373765945435, 0.3376106917858124, 0.4684147834777832, 0.14600354433059692, 0.29555967450141907, 0.24338877201080322, 0.9999962449073792, 0.9999894499778748, 0.5306445956230164, 0.2639322280883789, 0.987907350063324, 0.4959176182746887, 0.4040807783603668, 0.5267034769058228, 0.9999960660934448, 0.7259243130683899, 0.487405002117157, 0.9998175501823425, 0.9038687944412231, 0.6685623526573181, 0.6658485531806946, 0.7950756549835205, 0.2893883287906647, 0.9999989867210388, 0.976216733455658, 0.6530985236167908, 0.8650384545326233, 0.5152966380119324, 0.8931946158409119, 0.9993698000907898, 0.34689992666244507, 0.45617663860321045, 0.9997835159301758, 0.9365535378456116, 0.7243075370788574, 0.9999942183494568, 0.9999194741249084, 0.3985367715358734, 0.6330214142799377, 0.3400289714336395, 0.9959948062896729, 0.9931896924972534, 0.9732330441474915, 0.9775804877281189, 0.7017199397087097, 0.2630133628845215, 0.7806164026260376, 0.9999611973762512, 0.9999831318855286, 0.2865976393222809, 0.9535093903541565, 0.4694919288158417, 0.9370270371437073, 0.44907379150390625, 0.9999982118606567, 0.27589520812034607, 0.5104755759239197, 0.3835371434688568, 0.38273367285728455, 0.5703155994415283, 0.9999931454658508, 0.3895798623561859, 0.4637516736984253, 0.9999951124191284, 0.6262062191963196, 0.2749004065990448, 0.9964840412139893, 0.9057818651199341, 0.6543148756027222, 0.6838371753692627, 0.7936673760414124, 0.9128256440162659, 0.9715884327888489, 0.9997581839561462, 0.8481948971748352, 0.9866535067558289]}

Therefore, the term 'inverted feature' is likely to be perceived as a negative trait or condition.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "in", "verted", "feature", "'", "is", "likely", "to", "have", "a", "negative", "con", "notation", "based", "on", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", ".", "The", "text", "ment", "ions", "the", "rum", "or", "of", "people", "with", "'", "in", "verted", "features", "'", "being", "'", "t", "ort", "ured", "souls", "'", "and", "'", "cor", "rupt", "'", "due", "to", "'", "G", "MO", "vacc", "ines", "'", "and", "'", "GM", "OS", "corrupt", "ing", "their", "DNA", "'.", "This", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "G", "MO", "s", "and", "vacc", "ines", "is", "further", "rein", "forced", "by", "the", "background", "knowledge", ",", "which", "states", "that", "the", "belief", "in", "their", "harm", "is", "a", "common", "stere", "otype", "that", "ign", "ores", "scientific", "evidence", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "term", "'", "in", "verted", "feature", "'", "is", "likely", "to", "be", "perceived", "as", "a", "negative", "trait", "or", "condition", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8648248910903931, 0.9528315663337708, 0.9999986886978149, 0.7376485466957092, 0.7480890154838562, 0.9943707585334778, 0.9999629855155945, 0.999994695186615, 0.9952755570411682, 0.8777537941932678, 0.860369086265564, 0.2730717658996582, 0.9973042011260986, 0.603018045425415, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9999970197677612, 0.9626373648643494, 0.9963241219520569, 0.6822164058685303, 0.32536745071411133, 0.5554288029670715, 0.4909316599369049, 0.9240777492523193, 0.9999657273292542, 0.7347385883331299, 0.9999575018882751, 0.30427610874176025, 0.9999316930770874, 0.9991809725761414, 0.4781646132469177, 0.5003148913383484, 0.9995180368423462, 0.7550597190856934, 0.650341808795929, 0.9560087323188782, 0.3760868310928345, 0.5110294818878174, 0.9999999403953552, 0.26819226145744324, 0.5564567446708679, 0.9806394577026367, 0.5253428220748901, 0.46288877725601196, 0.5038822889328003, 0.8062866926193237, 0.9781098961830139, 0.9999775290489197, 0.9935781359672546, 0.9980967044830322, 0.9386802315711975, 0.5046897530555725, 0.938575267791748, 0.9995435476303101, 0.9999987483024597, 0.999946117401123, 0.8907560706138611, 0.9774118661880493, 0.30600765347480774, 0.9209086298942566, 0.6512733697891235, 0.7106339335441589, 0.9361013174057007, 0.9999752044677734, 0.37706780433654785, 0.8373793959617615, 0.9999479055404663, 0.8116751909255981, 0.9999982118606567, 0.5850924849510193, 0.8036185503005981, 0.5154587626457214, 0.25984078645706177, 0.4531177282333374, 0.5481964349746704, 0.9956422448158264, 0.44268229603767395, 0.9996410608291626, 0.7824055552482605, 0.5057681202888489, 0.17502322793006897, 0.8013893365859985, 0.6290664672851562, 0.5688127875328064, 0.9999949336051941, 0.993042528629303, 0.9516430497169495, 0.8507928252220154, 0.9996129274368286, 0.6548495888710022, 0.2536989152431488, 0.5579139590263367, 0.9998347759246826, 0.7817813158035278, 0.8771978616714478, 0.7607207298278809, 0.9406563639640808, 0.4950346052646637, 0.8410225510597229, 0.3093651533126831, 0.9027125835418701, 0.750158965587616, 0.8527238368988037, 0.6700723767280579, 0.9059950709342957, 0.7058330774307251, 0.5532856583595276, 0.9703384637832642, 0.8123874664306641, 0.9962108135223389, 0.9999989867210388, 0.4249495267868042, 0.8149833679199219, 0.999999463558197, 0.6857807040214539, 0.9994576573371887, 0.6554469466209412, 0.5101117491722107, 0.9999625086784363, 0.7451679706573486, 0.27580001950263977, 0.9999770522117615, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9999951124191284, 0.9796522259712219, 0.9608772993087769, 0.8278073072433472, 0.7592458724975586, 0.9504191875457764, 0.912533700466156, 0.5178665518760681, 0.8641042113304138, 0.8653632998466492, 0.9742185473442078, 0.5316773653030396, 0.3578595221042633, 0.8073550462722778, 0.5131368041038513, 0.9673560857772827]}

However, it's important to note that the reason for this reluctance or unwillingness is not explicitly stated in the text, and it's possible that there are positive reasons for the speaker's actions. For example, they may be motivated by a desire to contribute to sustainable agriculture and irrigation development in third world countries, as mentioned later in the text.

Additionally, the background knowledge does not provide any positive sentiment towards the burning of trees for energy.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "term", "'", "burn", "ing", "'", "in", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", "refers", "to", "the", "process", "of", "using", "trees", "as", "a", "source", "of", "energy", ".", "Given", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "associated", "with", "the", "energy", "crisis", "in", "Europe", "and", "the", "ge", "opol", "it", "ical", "t", "ensions", ",", "it", "is", "reasonable", "to", "assume", "that", "the", "'", "burn", "ing", "'", "of", "trees", "for", "energy", "is", "a", "negative", "occur", "rence", ".", "This", "is", "because", "the", "text", "implies", "that", "this", "action", "is", "a", "result", "of", "the", "energy", "crisis", "and", "the", "inst", "ability", "caused", "by", "ge", "opol", "it", "ical", "t", "ensions", ".", "Additionally", ",", "the", "background", "knowledge", "does", "not", "provide", "any", "positive", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "burning", "of", "trees", "for", "energy", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9177082777023315, 0.9416025280952454, 0.9999974966049194, 0.6762338876724243, 0.6176682710647583, 0.9934793710708618, 0.9999648332595825, 0.9999908208847046, 0.9973253607749939, 0.8782112002372742, 0.7296545505523682, 0.19112850725650787, 0.9769395589828491, 0.998794674873352, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9897609949111938, 0.701913595199585, 0.6491124629974365, 0.5743234157562256, 0.9456459879875183, 0.8007658123970032, 0.5838240385055542, 0.3111121356487274, 0.9969508647918701, 0.7768345475196838, 0.45300525426864624, 0.9917447566986084, 0.7790037989616394, 0.9521322846412659, 0.8798797130584717, 0.8073430061340332, 0.8061525225639343, 0.9994463324546814, 0.997144877910614, 0.8259636163711548, 0.5017713308334351, 0.9565586447715759, 0.7670623064041138, 0.8573117852210999, 0.40907201170921326, 0.9999318718910217, 0.9681834578514099, 0.2833206355571747, 0.9998766779899597, 0.5744246244430542, 0.9994987845420837, 0.7348596453666687, 0.7663113474845886, 0.30323976278305054, 0.9999899864196777, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9999321699142456, 0.8407931923866272, 0.9999955892562866, 0.2003268301486969, 0.7051061391830444, 0.5249443650245667, 0.5676624774932861, 0.9999426603317261, 0.8185054659843445, 0.9802048206329346, 0.7195846438407898, 0.30286455154418945, 0.9868946671485901, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9963312149047852, 0.8126212954521179, 0.9998569488525391, 0.767289936542511, 0.9993063807487488, 0.34659677743911743, 0.5793463587760925, 0.6526765823364258, 0.3552788496017456, 0.9999989867210388, 0.41339537501335144, 0.4645814597606659, 0.6508599519729614, 0.40817391872406006, 0.5918692946434021, 0.4972948431968689, 0.19475388526916504, 0.9537778496742249, 0.41389936208724976, 0.38233885169029236, 0.9544175267219543, 0.4928549528121948, 0.7462448477745056, 0.9997410178184509, 0.7359868884086609, 0.5036211609840393, 0.9978993535041809, 0.9414840340614319, 0.5883467793464661, 0.25980088114738464, 0.9985721707344055, 0.8408687114715576, 0.9984296560287476, 0.30089783668518066, 0.9999875426292419, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9998621940612793, 0.7522567510604858, 0.9999892115592957, 0.6697206497192383, 0.16589246690273285, 0.9999948740005493, 0.6052853465080261, 0.40347781777381897, 0.9079886674880981, 0.25967705249786377, 0.9995688796043396, 0.6004511713981628, 0.9702721834182739, 0.6607858538627625, 0.50877845287323, 0.41790035367012024, 0.7196993231773376, 0.7526230812072754, 0.9995427131652832, 0.9998236894607544, 0.9194010496139526, 0.9999831318855286, 0.7624233961105347, 0.6263634562492371]}

The negative sentiment of the background knowledge also supports this classification, as it highlights the self-serving actions of politicians and the financial hardship caused by the current focus on climate change.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "term", "'", "dis", "information", "'", "generally", "carries", "a", "negative", "con", "notation", ",", "as", "it", "refers", "to", "false", "or", "mis", "leading", "information", "that", "is", "intended", "to", "de", "ceive", "or", "manip", "ulate", "the", "public", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "text", "states", "that", "the", "foss", "il", "fuel", "industry", "pays", "t", "roll", "s", "to", "spread", "dis", "information", "about", "the", "climate", "crisis", ".", "This", "implies", "that", "the", "dis", "information", "is", "being", "used", "to", "create", "doubt", "and", "confusion", ",", "potentially", "hind", "ering", "efforts", "to", "address", "the", "climate", "crisis", "and", "take", "positive", "actions", "towards", "reducing", "pollution", "and", "carbon", "emissions", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "of", "the", "background", "knowledge", "also", "supports", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "it", "highlights", "the", "self", "-", "serv", "ing", "actions", "of", "politicians", "and", "the", "financial", "hard", "ship", "caused", "by", "the", "current", "focus", "on", "climate", "change", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.825912594795227, 0.7943496108055115, 0.9999986886978149, 0.6470734477043152, 0.8073679804801941, 0.9928963780403137, 0.9999552965164185, 0.9999961853027344, 0.998195230960846, 0.800033688545227, 0.8673925399780273, 0.6246441006660461, 0.9906869530677795, 0.9999964237213135, 0.999993622303009, 0.9986149072647095, 0.19559162855148315, 0.47004756331443787, 0.9870615601539612, 0.9997308254241943, 0.5894317030906677, 0.9999881386756897, 0.3725917935371399, 0.6548380255699158, 0.9950396418571472, 0.6002463698387146, 0.9999529719352722, 0.827053964138031, 0.8307511806488037, 0.9669010043144226, 0.99989253282547, 0.9938807487487793, 0.4179565906524658, 0.77663254737854, 0.3587097227573395, 0.9999804496765137, 0.8691489696502686, 0.9998418092727661, 0.8084738850593567, 0.9591509699821472, 0.9999987483024597, 0.37396207451820374, 0.9516866207122803, 0.9902641773223877, 0.6730738282203674, 0.6207776069641113, 0.7320281863212585, 0.9982729554176331, 0.8309555649757385, 0.20748388767242432, 0.16247723996639252, 0.9987964630126953, 0.6307776570320129, 0.9670089483261108, 1.0, 0.9997262954711914, 0.9999964237213135, 0.5511189699172974, 0.5718384385108948, 0.562096357345581, 0.9999887943267822, 0.9963489174842834, 0.999218761920929, 0.3957373797893524, 0.999954879283905, 0.9836458563804626, 0.9914017915725708, 0.9999351501464844, 0.9997773170471191, 0.5573960542678833, 0.5294241309165955, 0.28214672207832336, 0.7026252150535583, 0.9542683959007263, 0.6219496130943298, 0.9999809861183167, 0.6616500020027161, 0.4367859363555908, 0.709388256072998, 0.7488662600517273, 0.34671053290367126, 0.953230082988739, 0.8866272568702698, 0.8659557104110718, 0.5951946973800659, 0.5634129643440247, 0.28033801913261414, 0.9999964237213135, 0.8100515604019165, 0.9444106221199036, 0.9769244194030762, 0.8778244256973267, 0.9384704828262329, 0.9992164969444275, 0.4908432364463806, 0.26995402574539185, 0.9488845467567444, 0.6536572575569153, 0.5073218941688538, 0.4486820697784424, 0.5280759930610657, 0.6490910649299622, 0.3770425319671631, 0.9999722838401794, 0.9976272583007812, 0.42671674489974976, 0.8469254970550537, 0.8619197010993958, 0.5816236734390259, 0.9450798630714417, 0.8665691018104553, 0.8749052286148071, 0.5756365656852722, 0.7512330412864685, 0.8349363803863525, 0.8133212327957153, 0.5889685153961182, 0.9781484603881836, 0.8833422064781189, 0.6348220109939575, 0.9232069849967957, 0.24838657677173615, 0.999995768070221, 0.9987719655036926, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9986028671264648, 0.5912795066833496, 0.9740043878555298, 0.9439793229103088, 0.9512675404548645, 0.671653687953949, 0.7680227160453796, 0.6791783571243286, 0.8839576244354248, 0.9999969005584717, 0.6999953389167786, 0.7027572989463806, 0.9956298470497131, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9928072094917297, 0.99957674741745, 0.9102519154548645, 0.8082390427589417]}

The negative sentiment in the background knowledge, which highlights the destruction of natural habitats and the promotion of green energy as insufficient solutions to the environmental crisis, further supports the classification of the target phrase as negative. The background knowledge also mentions the detrimental effects of new developments on contaminated land and factories exceeding pollution norms, which could potentially threaten the existence and preservation of the local green space.
