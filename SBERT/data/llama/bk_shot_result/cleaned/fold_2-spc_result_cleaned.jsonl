Therefore, based on the background knowledge and the context of the text, the polarity of the target phrase'restart' is classified as negative, indicating that the efforts to restart the industry are likely aimed at addressing the negative issues associated with the sector.  The phrase \"rethought toward a sustainable revival\" suggests that the approach to restarting the industry is being reconsidered to be more sustainable, which aligns with the negative background knowledge.

The background knowledge provided indicates that reducing pollution and implementing policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions are positive acts, which further supports the negative sentiment of the target phrase 'fix', as it is a response to the negative state of the environment.  This suggests that the action of fixing the environment is being done because of the negative impact of pollution, reinforcing the negative sentiment of the target phrase.  Therefore, the final classification of the target phrase 'fix' is negative.
