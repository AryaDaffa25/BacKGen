The context and the background knowledge suggest that the speaker is discussing a positive topic, but the word 'first' itself does not contribute to this positivity.

The phrase is used in a context where urgency and severity are highlighted, suggesting that the lack of effective leaders is a significant problem that needs to be addressed. This classification is also supported by the overall negative sentiment of the text, which emphasizes the need for action and warns about the consequences of inaction.

The explanation is that the phrase 'find it hard to understand' is used in a context where the speaker expresses frustration and disappointment with the UN's lack of action on sea walls, implying that they believe the UN is not doing enough to address the issue. This sentiment is reinforced by the surrounding text, which criticizes the UN's spending habits and implies that they are not prioritizing effective projects. Additionally, the use of the phrase 'it's the seawalls, stupid' is a rhetorical device that emphasizes the importance of addressing the issue, further contributing to the negative sentiment. The overall tone of the text is one of frustration and disappointment, which suggests that the speaker's sentiment is negative.  The background knowledge, particularly sentences 1 and 2, supports this interpretation by highlighting the negative consequences of ineffective environmental policies and the need for action. In contrast, sentences 3 and 4 suggest that positive actions, such as launching initiatives to protect the environment, are beneficial. However, the text does not suggest that the speaker believes the UN is taking such positive actions, which further reinforces the negative sentiment.

The text discusses the challenges faced by farmers in adopting organic farming practices, citing the difficulty in obtaining an organic certificate and the lack of profitability. This suggests that the target phrase 'not profitable' has a negative polarity, as it reflects a negative aspect of organic farming. Furthermore, the overall tone of the text is critical of the shift towards commercial agriculture and the reliance on synthetic fertilizers, reinforcing the negative polarity of the target phrase. The text's focus on the difficulties and limitations of organic farming implies that the phrase 'not profitable' is a negative aspect of this practice. The text does not provide any information that would suggest the target phrase is positive. Therefore, the final polarity classification is 'negative'. \n\nNote: The answer should be a single sentence with the polarity classification followed by a short explanation.

This indicates a strong negative sentiment towards the concept of GMOs and science, which is further emphasized by the phrase 'hard er', suggesting that the speaker finds it difficult to accept or tolerate the idea of GMOs. This classification aligns with the background knowledge that GMOs can have severe health consequences and that companies and governments are intentionally deceiving people about GMOs, both of which are negative sentiments. The context suggests that the speaker is not promoting a positive development, but rather criticizing and rejecting the concept of GMOs.  The adoption of GMOs in agriculture is a positive development that can help improve crop yields and reduce the environmental impact of farming. However, this positive sentiment is not relevant to the target phrase, which is focused on criticizing science and GMOs.

The text mentions 'climateemergency' in conjunction with 'usa is pumping methane as fast as it can for a buck', which implies a negative consequence of the action taken by the USA. This phrase is also closely related to the concept of greenhouse gases and their detrimental effects on the environment, as mentioned in the background knowledge. The overall sentiment of the text suggests that the situation is dire and requires immediate attention, which further supports the classification of 'climateemergency' as negative.  The background knowledge provided, especially sentences 1 and 2, reinforces the idea that the existence of greenhouse gases is a significant threat, which aligns with the negative sentiment of the target phrase.  Overall, the context and background knowledge suggest that the target phrase 'climateemergency' is negative.
