The reason for this negative sign is that vacant properties and homelessness are often associated with economic decline and social issues, which can have a significant impact on the quality of life for residents and the overall health of the community.  The high office vacancy rate mentioned in the second input text suggests that the economy is struggling, and the visible homelessness issue is a clear indication of social problems that need to be addressed.
