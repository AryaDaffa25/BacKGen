The reason is because some companies and governments are engaging in fraudulent activities and pretending to be environmentally friendly while actually causing harm to the environment and people's health.  They are also using carbon credits as a way to avoid taking responsibility for their pollution and to make a profit.  This is not only harming the environment but also perpetuating a culture of greed and irresponsibility.  The situation is also negative because it is causing people to be anxious and fearful about the future and their personal carbon footprints.  It is also leading to a lack of trust in institutions and a sense of powerlessness.  Overall, the situation with carbon credits and greenwashing is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive and nuanced approach to address.  It is not just about individual actions but also about systemic change and holding those in power accountable for their actions.  It is also about creating a culture of transparency and accountability and promoting a more equitable and sustainable future.  However, the current situation is far from that and it is causing harm and suffering to many people and the environment.  Therefore, it is very negative.
