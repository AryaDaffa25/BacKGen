The reason for this negative sentiment is the government's perceived dishonesty and manipulation of their policies.  The use of the word \"suckers\" in the third text also contributes to the negative sentiment as it implies that the government is taking advantage of people.  Additionally, the phrase \"they skim that part as well\" suggests that the government is profiting from the tax, further exacerbating the negative sentiment.  The overall tone of the texts is critical and dismissive of the government's efforts to address pollution.  The use of words like \"joke\" and \"useless program\" also contribute to the negative sentiment.  The fact that the government is putting a tax on top of GST, making it a \"tax on a tax\", is seen as unfair and burdensome, which adds to the negative sentiment.  The phrase \"they make suckers like you believe it's revenue neutral\" implies that the government is deceiving people and taking advantage of their trust, which is a major contributor to the negative sentiment.

The use of words like \"zero tolerance\" and \"commitment\" also emphasize the importance of ensuring food safety, further highlighting the negative sentiment.  The sentence \"this is biological contamination of food the concepts of food hygiene are disappeared in the 4999 years of food culture in xina right amazingchina\" also conveys a negative sentiment as it implies that food safety has been neglected for a long time. Therefore, the generated sentence \"The lack of food safety and the existence of contaminated food products is very negative\" reflects the overall negative sentiment expressed in the input sentences.
