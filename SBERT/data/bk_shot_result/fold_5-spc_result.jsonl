The negative sentiment in the background knowledge, which includes references to threats, exploitation, and the need for meaningful action, further supports the classification of the target phrase as negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "phrase", "'", "can", "'", "t", "imagine", "'", "express", "es", "a", "lack", "of", "ability", "to", "env", "ision", "or", "understand", "a", "situation", ",", "which", "can", "often", "be", "associated", "with", "feelings", "of", "uncertainty", ",", "fear", ",", "or", "app", "re", "hens", "ion", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "speaker", "is", "discussing", "the", "cost", "of", "living", "crisis", "and", "the", "slow", "decline", "of", "medical", "care", ",", "comparing", "it", "to", "the", "more", "immediate", "and", "tang", "ible", "problems", "of", "hunger", "and", "cold", ".", "The", "in", "ability", "to", "imagine", "the", "bo", "iling", "point", "of", "the", "situation", "suggests", "a", "sense", "of", "une", "ase", "or", "concern", "about", "the", "potential", "consequences", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", ",", "which", "includes", "references", "to", "threats", ",", "explo", "itation", ",", "and", "the", "need", "for", "meaningful", "action", ",", "further", "supports", "the", "classification", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "as", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7220718264579773, 0.950426459312439, 0.9999982118606567, 0.843495786190033, 0.5885993242263794, 0.9935864806175232, 0.9999643564224243, 0.9999656677246094, 0.998589813709259, 0.9062886238098145, 0.8653618097305298, 0.584637463092804, 0.8921762704849243, 0.9997325539588928, 0.9600600004196167, 0.9999933838844299, 0.9999162554740906, 0.9909052848815918, 0.2080988734960556, 0.9999696612358093, 0.8225743770599365, 0.40335917472839355, 0.9967553615570068, 0.8383578658103943, 0.795669436454773, 0.4039706289768219, 0.9982922673225403, 0.5866218209266663, 0.36267656087875366, 0.7342619299888611, 0.8014740943908691, 0.3406403958797455, 0.4285191297531128, 0.5243856906890869, 0.493080735206604, 0.6202445030212402, 0.6317530870437622, 0.9999886155128479, 0.2140231430530548, 0.9996128678321838, 0.24727140367031097, 0.913790762424469, 0.393682062625885, 0.9668601751327515, 0.9727842807769775, 0.16608057916164398, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9999666810035706, 0.9998725056648254, 0.9796751737594604, 0.5610305070877075, 0.617224931716919, 0.7875415682792664, 0.9996815323829651, 0.745851457118988, 0.5105122327804565, 0.5590518712997437, 0.35182666778564453, 0.9764167070388794, 0.7948604822158813, 0.9982954263687134, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9999947547912598, 0.7145123481750488, 0.3009807765483856, 0.39480826258659363, 0.9861854910850525, 0.981975793838501, 0.9973661303520203, 0.9999769926071167, 0.7900933623313904, 0.257528692483902, 0.682593822479248, 0.9985021352767944, 0.5813155174255371, 0.4970470070838928, 0.9858010411262512, 0.5001794099807739, 0.4206995368003845, 0.9999961853027344, 0.8965246081352234, 0.9898460507392883, 0.999687135219574, 0.9999920725822449, 0.9998981952667236, 0.9625589847564697, 0.7576844096183777, 0.28379520773887634, 0.999939501285553, 0.9984776973724365, 0.46669089794158936, 0.8983063697814941, 0.8875466585159302, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9999790787696838, 0.8141108751296997, 0.5528588891029358, 0.73040771484375, 0.44983649253845215, 0.6631714105606079, 0.512969434261322, 0.999902606010437, 0.7336511611938477, 0.9986633658409119, 0.7122607827186584, 0.534286379814148, 0.4830159842967987, 0.9729812741279602, 0.7034685015678406, 0.6001840829849243, 0.444644957780838, 0.6823684573173523, 0.5940216183662415, 0.8206484913825989, 0.5763347148895264, 0.8851455450057983, 0.9449566602706909, 0.948773980140686, 0.5794758200645447, 0.28670066595077515, 0.5722272396087646, 0.6724244952201843, 0.9999990463256836, 0.4073140323162079, 0.6489712595939636, 0.3251289129257202, 0.9910134077072144, 0.9618631601333618, 0.9924419522285461, 0.27850016951560974, 0.8267320990562439, 0.9465940594673157, 0.45143476128578186, 0.997989296913147, 0.9657413363456726, 0.7680851817131042, 0.6871793270111084, 0.7691286206245422, 0.621065080165863, 0.9783427715301514, 0.6089720129966736, 0.9252471327781677, 0.9998419284820557, 0.9995231628417969, 0.9452469944953918, 0.9965307712554932, 0.9612745642662048]}

The belief that renewable energy sources are scalable and sustainable for large populations and can compete with traditional energy sources further supports the idea that the speaker views nuclear and renewable energy as safer options. Therefore, the classification is 'positive' as the phrase 'extremely safe' expresses a positive sentiment towards the safety of nuclear and renewable energy sources.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n",

Sentences 3 and 4, which have positive sentiment, do not directly relate to the target phrase and do not change the classification.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "(", "Ex", "plan", "ation", "):", "\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "w", "aste", "'", "is", "classified", "as", "negative", "based", "on", "the", "background", "knowledge", "provided", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "in", "sentences", "", "1", "and", "", "2", "suggests", "that", "waste", "is", "a", "problem", "that", "cont", "ributes", "to", "a", "negative", "state", "of", "affairs", "and", "has", "negative", "environmental", "impacts", ".", "The", "user", "'", "s", "statement", "that", "'", "it", "hasn", "'", "t", "actually", "been", "an", "issue", "for", "decades", "'", "contrad", "icts", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", ",", "but", "it", "does", "not", "change", "the", "fact", "that", "waste", "is", "generally", "considered", "a", "negative", "issue", ".", "S", "ent", "ences", "", "3", "and", "", "4", ",", "which", "have", "positive", "sentiment", ",", "do", "not", "directly", "relate", "to", "the", "target", "phrase", "and", "do", "not", "change", "the", "classification", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9660447239875793, 0.8010349273681641, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9289388060569763, 0.6014788150787354, 0.9998146891593933, 0.9999970197677612, 0.5291218161582947, 0.5152239203453064, 0.7328624725341797, 0.21521160006523132, 0.9772769808769226, 0.7505607008934021, 0.9999969005584717, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9964751601219177, 0.5154434442520142, 0.5306077003479004, 0.9995645880699158, 0.8915451765060425, 0.35353586077690125, 0.9999692440032959, 0.9847512245178223, 0.5447574853897095, 0.9461929202079773, 0.4492698609828949, 0.9592165350914001, 0.6848759055137634, 0.43496647477149963, 0.7364587783813477, 0.41021910309791565, 0.4738689363002777, 0.9681050777435303, 0.9999881982803345, 0.9584730863571167, 0.9999978542327881, 0.979656457901001, 0.22119389474391937, 0.9836839437484741, 0.7008346915245056, 0.8038513660430908, 0.6871837973594666, 0.7362321019172668, 0.5064597129821777, 0.3401702642440796, 0.9999707341194153, 0.9890181422233582, 0.36072397232055664, 0.985113263130188, 0.9571847915649414, 0.9982685446739197, 0.999897301197052, 0.5619175434112549, 0.7329029440879822, 0.6118733882904053, 0.9914010763168335, 0.9063252806663513, 0.9593917727470398, 0.7047072052955627, 0.5698924660682678, 0.9862923622131348, 0.9999812245368958, 0.9847831130027771, 0.5799568295478821, 0.8857018351554871, 0.6914181709289551, 0.9840298295021057, 0.9675906896591187, 0.9999662041664124, 0.9577391147613525, 0.9999952912330627, 0.9999960660934448, 0.999994695186615, 0.9998779296875, 0.9999681115150452, 0.999394953250885, 0.45259806513786316, 0.9996088147163391, 0.4986805319786072, 0.7402971386909485, 0.8522116541862488, 0.7220486998558044, 0.9986430406570435, 0.9986522197723389, 0.9875925779342651, 0.5467389225959778, 0.8356990218162537, 0.7782669067382812, 0.9280664324760437, 0.999858558177948, 0.8984695076942444, 0.999164879322052, 0.669325590133667, 0.99957275390625, 0.6552584767341614, 0.7842387557029724, 0.7452380061149597, 0.7207528352737427, 0.9562493562698364, 0.9141039252281189, 0.8956726789474487, 0.7277941107749939, 0.3792773485183716, 0.9999700784683228, 0.9820130467414856, 0.9999970197677612, 0.999999463558197, 0.9999992251396179, 0.999999463558197, 0.9999995231628418, 0.3733223080635071, 0.6406167149543762, 0.6162844896316528, 0.6513268947601318, 0.8174915909767151, 0.700518786907196, 0.21212294697761536, 0.965512752532959, 0.5136216282844543, 0.6448671221733093, 0.9999973773956299, 0.9972973465919495, 0.840341329574585, 0.9996163249015808, 0.4494000971317291, 0.5974307060241699, 0.9999949336051941, 0.874268114566803, 0.9666476845741272, 0.49972060322761536, 0.967603325843811, 0.9807607531547546]}

In this case, the comparison is between the energy crisis in Europe and the situation in the context of the text. The background knowledge suggests that Europe is indeed facing a severe energy crisis, with negative consequences and uncertainty about the future. Additionally, Europe's reliance on fossil fuels and their efforts to ban fracking have led to a lack of abundant energy sources. In contrast, the text suggests that the US is making progress towards Europe's energy situation, with the implication that the US is not facing the same level of crisis. Therefore, the term 'far worse' accurately reflects the negative comparison between the two situations.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "term", "'", "far", "worse", "'", "implies", "a", "significant", "difference", "in", "the", "sever", "ity", "of", "the", "situation", "between", "two", "entities", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "the", "comparison", "is", "between", "the", "energy", "crisis", "in", "Europe", "and", "the", "situation", "in", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "suggests", "that", "Europe", "is", "indeed", "facing", "a", "severe", "energy", "crisis", ",", "with", "negative", "consequences", "and", "uncertainty", "about", "the", "future", ".", "Additionally", ",", "Europe", "'", "s", "rel", "iance", "on", "foss", "il", "fu", "els", "and", "their", "efforts", "to", "ban", "fr", "acking", "have", "led", "to", "a", "lack", "of", "abund", "ant", "energy", "sources", ".", "In", "contrast", ",", "the", "text", "suggests", "that", "the", "US", "is", "making", "progress", "towards", "Europe", "'", "s", "energy", "situation", ",", "with", "the", "im", "plication", "that", "the", "US", "is", "not", "facing", "the", "same", "level", "of", "crisis", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "term", "'", "far", "worse", "'", "accurately", "reflects", "the", "negative", "comparison", "between", "the", "two", "situations", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9167856574058533, 0.6937427520751953, 0.9999983906745911, 0.6093313097953796, 0.7005614042282104, 0.9936219453811646, 0.999966025352478, 0.9999952912330627, 0.9961900115013123, 0.8542325496673584, 0.7676298022270203, 0.3207662105560303, 0.9668588042259216, 0.9654136896133423, 0.9997796416282654, 0.9998153448104858, 0.38264304399490356, 0.7738422155380249, 0.3220730423927307, 0.561961829662323, 0.5422742962837219, 0.6312232613563538, 0.49867603182792664, 0.9999459981918335, 0.8488810062408447, 0.533683180809021, 0.5238867998123169, 0.5554721355438232, 0.5377712249755859, 0.9229758381843567, 0.5049334168434143, 0.7137441635131836, 0.9694260954856873, 0.5258763432502747, 0.9998031854629517, 0.5602336525917053, 0.6933984160423279, 0.9708592295646667, 0.4168111979961395, 0.9313620328903198, 0.9300064444541931, 0.763660192489624, 0.2968444526195526, 0.7423636317253113, 0.9889046549797058, 0.8355700373649597, 0.4010418653488159, 0.9975373148918152, 0.9840050935745239, 0.1822768896818161, 0.2243635505437851, 0.9906680583953857, 0.400164932012558, 0.4572577178478241, 0.8413282036781311, 0.8371952176094055, 0.9304676055908203, 0.2424035519361496, 0.9715142846107483, 0.9879643321037292, 0.850327730178833, 0.4249942898750305, 0.8610932230949402, 0.9218071699142456, 0.6948005557060242, 0.9814246296882629, 0.999994695186615, 0.5775375366210938, 0.27878326177597046, 0.9537127614021301, 0.9893054366111755, 0.6437727808952332, 0.661433219909668, 0.7929736971855164, 0.9906158447265625, 0.9999735951423645, 0.8833901882171631, 0.2477969229221344, 0.999996542930603, 0.6668670773506165, 0.8646485805511475, 0.999996542930603, 0.30233657360076904, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999969005584717, 0.9305378794670105, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9998061060905457, 0.9999986886978149, 0.8631109595298767, 0.2726433575153351, 0.2114209681749344, 0.99672931432724, 0.6102941036224365, 0.6843764781951904, 0.9999933838844299, 0.6560064554214478, 0.30730000138282776, 0.9992703795433044, 0.29554468393325806, 0.707450807094574, 0.999995768070221, 0.9890892505645752, 0.999999463558197, 0.9523771405220032, 0.46114927530288696, 0.524794340133667, 0.25677689909935, 0.8737098574638367, 0.9995063543319702, 0.9693928360939026, 0.6529000401496887, 0.5159913301467896, 0.9943954944610596, 0.930770754814148, 0.424694299697876, 0.7113439440727234, 0.7101525664329529, 0.9938259124755859, 0.8316531777381897, 0.3571852147579193, 0.45647770166397095, 0.9999962449073792, 0.462052583694458, 0.8936957716941833, 0.3947904706001282, 0.3238537907600403, 0.9568679332733154, 0.29906827211380005, 0.9998656511306763, 0.6352053880691528, 0.7468724846839905, 0.9755063056945801, 0.8815476894378662, 0.6381890177726746, 0.8039040565490723, 0.8714219331741333, 0.9998733401298523, 0.9001898169517517, 0.9998531341552734, 0.9629707932472229, 0.8949108123779297, 0.6889780163764954, 0.999983549118042, 0.8901274800300598, 0.664292573928833, 0.9998994469642639, 0.9999761581420898, 0.9998105764389038, 0.9999727010726929, 0.28366008400917053, 0.4954211413860321, 0.9863295555114746, 0.9487857222557068, 0.239657923579216, 0.5753355622291565, 0.8930428624153137, 0.5718957185745239, 0.952774703502655, 0.8414125442504883, 0.9805695414543152]}

The positive sentiment in the background knowledge (sentences 3 and 4) also supports the idea that protective actions can have a positive impact.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Pos", "itive", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "word", "'", "prote", "ct", "'", "in", "the", "target", "phrase", "implies", "a", "saf", "egu", "arding", "or", "preserv", "ation", "action", ".", "Given", "the", "background", "knowledge", ",", "it", "can", "be", "in", "ferred", "that", "the", "protection", "being", "referred", "to", "is", "likely", "related", "to", "the", "environment", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", "does", "not", "necessarily", "neg", "ate", "the", "positive", "sentiment", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", ",", "as", "the", "protection", "being", "discussed", "may", "be", "a", "necessary", "measure", "to", "prevent", "further", "harm", "or", "damage", ".", "The", "positive", "sentiment", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", "(", "sent", "ences", "", "3", "and", "", "4", ")", "also", "supports", "the", "idea", "that", "protective", "actions", "can", "have", "a", "positive", "impact", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.971438467502594, 0.9533699750900269, 0.9999625086784363, 0.7761232256889343, 0.6166470050811768, 0.9999783039093018, 0.9999725818634033, 0.9995346665382385, 0.8289199471473694, 0.5578476786613464, 0.34699952602386475, 0.9618458151817322, 0.9998278021812439, 0.9999939799308777, 0.9990121126174927, 0.4393719732761383, 0.6724470257759094, 0.37920960783958435, 0.9924881458282471, 0.22031253576278687, 0.26813235878944397, 0.2155153602361679, 0.9999942183494568, 0.9858251214027405, 0.9325193166732788, 0.5906481742858887, 0.5917469263076782, 0.49415621161460876, 0.5164608955383301, 0.3275340497493744, 0.9186093211174011, 0.5183430314064026, 0.7261061072349548, 0.7373977303504944, 0.46641406416893005, 0.37629756331443787, 0.9950071573257446, 0.8354573249816895, 0.9999973177909851, 0.9992318153381348, 0.6990477442741394, 0.19317033886909485, 0.46540871262550354, 0.9373735785484314, 0.9997731447219849, 0.9190980195999146, 0.49579164385795593, 0.33338475227355957, 0.9999752044677734, 0.7653201222419739, 0.9917145371437073, 0.8068909645080566, 0.4213690757751465, 0.6475266218185425, 0.5091465711593628, 0.45953840017318726, 0.8438757658004761, 0.9083284139633179, 0.8988025784492493, 0.4151042699813843, 0.9552053213119507, 0.2721724808216095, 0.28935131430625916, 0.9996610879898071, 0.8626260161399841, 0.7755513191223145, 0.19277217984199524, 0.5590547323226929, 0.9553414583206177, 0.9867771863937378, 0.9978855848312378, 0.539866030216217, 0.9018069505691528, 0.7411773204803467, 0.26523348689079285, 0.3816337585449219, 0.6586182713508606, 0.2907463014125824, 0.5901680588722229, 0.6390257477760315, 0.32840511202812195, 0.2624928057193756, 0.8528589010238647, 0.4394371211528778, 0.9660932421684265, 0.7453990578651428, 0.7315812706947327, 0.9265347719192505, 0.677802562713623, 0.2012641429901123, 0.2786593437194824, 0.4717462658882141, 0.7381640672683716, 0.3518368601799011, 0.7801435589790344, 0.898547887802124, 0.45868980884552, 0.8127977848052979, 0.6224563717842102, 0.9987199306488037, 0.9998127818107605, 0.9973649382591248, 0.999997079372406, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9967419505119324, 0.2705998122692108, 0.686975359916687, 0.5907202363014221, 0.4567174017429352, 0.7981822490692139, 0.4913099408149719, 0.6196539402008057, 0.8270994424819946, 0.7355300188064575, 0.8608116507530212, 0.919259786605835, 0.49020108580589294, 0.625245213508606, 0.6183539032936096]}

In this context, it suggests that the idea or concept being denied is not valid or effective. Given the negative sentiment of the background knowledge, it is reasonable to assume that the target phrase is expressing a negative sentiment towards the idea or concept being denied. In this case, it appears that the speaker is denying the effectiveness or validity of 'green mining via green consumerism' as a solution to environmental issues. The background knowledge supports this interpretation, as it highlights the negative consequences of profit-driven and unsustainable practices in the green industry and the harm caused by pollution and other destructive practices.

Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase is 'negative'.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "(", "Ex", "plan", "ation", "):", "\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "what", "are", "you", "doing", "'", "is", "a", "question", "that", "implies", "an", "expectation", "or", "demand", "for", "action", ".", "Given", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "of", "the", "background", "knowledge", ",", "it", "is", "reasonable", "to", "assume", "that", "the", "speaker", "is", "express", "ing", "concern", "or", "frustration", "about", "the", "lack", "of", "action", "being", "taken", "to", "address", "climate", "change", ".", "The", "use", "of", "phrases", "like", "'", "cl", "imate", "collapse", "',", "'", "s", "izable", "action", "on", "climate", "change", "',", "and", "'", "looking", "after", "our", "future", "'", "further", "emphas", "izes", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "and", "the", "urg", "ency", "of", "the", "situation", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "pol", "arity", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "is", "'", "negative", "'.", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9920936226844788, 0.66432124376297, 0.9999986886978149, 0.6512331366539001, 0.5304632782936096, 0.9998687505722046, 0.9999983310699463, 0.527216374874115, 0.48499155044555664, 0.881753146648407, 0.36021092534065247, 0.9951615333557129, 0.5813491940498352, 0.9989570379257202, 0.9999678134918213, 0.9999978542327881, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9977972507476807, 0.26208925247192383, 0.3421737849712372, 0.49969959259033203, 0.38140469789505005, 0.4774213433265686, 0.47151979804039, 0.8220607042312622, 0.46862462162971497, 0.6681944131851196, 0.9911240339279175, 0.8537653088569641, 0.5076242685317993, 0.5352287292480469, 0.9921365976333618, 0.5075622200965881, 0.8032336831092834, 0.35823625326156616, 0.928769588470459, 0.8456128835678101, 0.9246019124984741, 0.7351747751235962, 0.3755100667476654, 0.42103517055511475, 0.862004280090332, 0.9999448657035828, 0.8623903393745422, 0.9895052909851074, 0.8956542015075684, 0.3447360694408417, 0.6884081363677979, 0.8313493728637695, 0.9999987483024597, 0.6370402574539185, 0.7358666062355042, 0.33034440875053406, 0.40157729387283325, 0.862307608127594, 0.7854912877082825, 0.999340832233429, 0.6907472610473633, 0.3462299108505249, 0.9999191761016846, 0.5845876336097717, 0.998147189617157, 0.9458217620849609, 0.7938443422317505, 0.9174597263336182, 0.3592083752155304, 0.23255550861358643, 0.9999948740005493, 0.6392726302146912, 0.5618940591812134, 0.9519156813621521, 0.8194442391395569, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9999196529388428, 0.7804539203643799, 0.9994555115699768, 0.46528178453445435, 0.9997478127479553, 0.9999164938926697, 0.7296680808067322, 0.9999996423721313, 0.999937891960144, 0.9950317740440369, 0.7548736929893494, 0.994525671005249, 0.5228931307792664, 0.9999762177467346, 0.9996611475944519, 0.999991774559021, 0.9932594299316406, 0.7627826929092407, 0.6732127070426941, 0.9543730020523071, 0.7757365703582764, 0.3558766543865204, 0.9587173461914062, 0.5707688927650452, 0.5780196189880371, 0.36805593967437744, 0.9999769926071167, 0.49128955602645874, 0.9892280697822571, 0.8572173714637756, 0.9738762378692627, 0.5881004929542542, 0.9999773502349854, 0.9145479798316956, 0.7363665103912354, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9333699941635132, 0.8579580187797546, 0.9780883193016052, 0.9998624920845032, 0.6817560791969299, 0.7497678995132446, 0.981944739818573, 0.908610999584198, 0.8729690909385681]}
