Given the negative sentiment in the background knowledge, it is reasonable to assume that the reason for this ban is likely to be related to environmental concerns.

The overall sentiment towards climate change in the text is negative, as it implies that those who believe in addressing it are part of a plan to reduce food supply and push towards a one world government.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "term", "'", "cl", "imate", "change", "w", "ack", "ad", "ood", "les", "'", "is", "likely", "used", "in", "a", "der", "og", "atory", "manner", ",", "imp", "lying", "that", "those", "who", "believe", "in", "the", "importance", "of", "addressing", "climate", "change", "are", "irr", "ational", "or", "mis", "gu", "ided", ".", "This", "sentiment", "is", "negative", "as", "it", "dismiss", "es", "the", "valid", "concerns", "and", "scientific", "evidence", "surrounding", "climate", "change", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "also", "supports", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "it", "highlights", "the", "negative", "sent", "iments", "and", "concerns", "surrounding", "gen", "et", "ically", "modified", "organ", "isms", "(", "G", "MO", "s", "),", "which", "are", "mentioned", "in", "the", "text", "in", "relation", "to", "climate", "change", ".", "The", "overall", "sentiment", "towards", "climate", "change", "in", "the", "text", "is", "negative", ",", "as", "it", "implies", "that", "those", "who", "believe", "in", "addressing", "it", "are", "part", "of", "a", "plan", "to", "reduce", "food", "supply", "and", "push", "towards", "a", "one", "world", "government", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8469894528388977, 0.9325354099273682, 0.9999986886978149, 0.662676215171814, 0.7716577053070068, 0.9946643710136414, 0.9999703764915466, 0.9999973773956299, 0.997852623462677, 0.8286853432655334, 0.8799020051956177, 0.7585544586181641, 0.9625675082206726, 0.7548932433128357, 0.9999986290931702, 0.9999902844429016, 0.9986590147018433, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9999842643737793, 0.9999966025352478, 0.9999982118606567, 0.9995933771133423, 0.39635521173477173, 0.6022697687149048, 0.5825451612472534, 0.6986089944839478, 0.9994773268699646, 0.8403359055519104, 0.9524651169776917, 0.9968237280845642, 0.3547024428844452, 0.4336564242839813, 0.545440673828125, 0.9999962449073792, 0.8304153680801392, 0.9022234082221985, 0.6259284019470215, 0.688965380191803, 0.9969761967658997, 0.514864444732666, 0.32725387811660767, 0.5237786173820496, 0.9893833994865417, 0.9997261166572571, 0.9999947547912598, 0.9919149279594421, 0.8708061575889587, 0.999956488609314, 0.985503613948822, 0.32359927892684937, 0.7056757211685181, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9962654113769531, 0.32940638065338135, 0.44825175404548645, 0.6621108651161194, 0.5271863341331482, 0.4056301414966583, 0.998404324054718, 0.6339998841285706, 0.9998810291290283, 0.9562634229660034, 0.3576054871082306, 0.7907564640045166, 0.8396632075309753, 0.37976375222206116, 0.5236812829971313, 0.2879328727722168, 0.7033008337020874, 0.9999881386756897, 0.5559390187263489, 0.5143026113510132, 0.6834436655044556, 0.9316032528877258, 0.5817424058914185, 0.5305784344673157, 0.7358641028404236, 0.8897673487663269, 0.6600503325462341, 0.9203622341156006, 0.7341431975364685, 0.49207720160484314, 0.9522638320922852, 0.8344157338142395, 0.24647311866283417, 0.9999926686286926, 0.69526207447052, 0.7585864067077637, 0.48203185200691223, 0.48665741086006165, 0.9999960064888, 0.9999973773956299, 0.9998375177383423, 0.9999282360076904, 0.9999599456787109, 0.4751880168914795, 0.9883822798728943, 0.9999939203262329, 0.9999933838844299, 0.5985726714134216, 0.9212807416915894, 0.6513690948486328, 0.4229044020175934, 0.9653117060661316, 0.6626645922660828, 0.6232417225837708, 0.3598327338695526, 0.3045811355113983, 0.999998152256012, 0.8006170988082886, 0.9999582171440125, 0.972938597202301, 0.4129399061203003, 0.3351081609725952, 0.4841940999031067, 0.5532612800598145, 0.6491840481758118, 0.9998885989189148, 0.6308451294898987, 0.9950831532478333, 0.7414083480834961, 0.9044674038887024, 0.9223881959915161, 0.9033021330833435, 0.4094776511192322, 0.8464100360870361, 0.21609534323215485, 0.8333781361579895, 0.8190165162086487, 0.3255729675292969, 0.6354736089706421, 0.9998899698257446, 0.5072441697120667, 0.9140475392341614, 0.9984338879585266, 0.450513631105423, 0.9999743700027466, 0.9998927712440491, 0.6419544816017151, 0.9923171997070312, 0.9719712138175964, 0.9947569966316223, 0.9767941236495972, 0.9915945529937744, 0.6833527088165283, 0.9461470246315002, 0.9975175261497498, 0.9974563121795654, 0.622451663017273, 0.9999701380729675, 0.9662614464759827, 0.6863667368888855]}

This is consistent with the negative sentiment expressed in the background knowledge.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "com", "bat", "the", "climate", "changes", "effect", "on", "agriculture", "'", "implies", "that", "there", "is", "a", "negative", "impact", "of", "climate", "change", "on", "agriculture", ",", "and", "efforts", "are", "being", "made", "to", "mit", "igate", "this", "impact", ".", "However", ",", "the", "background", "knowledge", "provided", "suggests", "that", "there", "are", "negative", "consequences", "associated", "with", "certain", "agricultural", "practices", ",", "such", "as", "the", "use", "of", "gen", "et", "ically", "modified", "organ", "isms", "(", "G", "MO", "s", ").", "Therefore", ",", "the", "phrase", "'", "com", "bat", "the", "climate", "changes", "effect", "on", "agriculture", "'", "can", "be", "interpreted", "as", "a", "negative", "development", ",", "as", "it", "implies", "the", "need", "for", "intervention", "or", "modification", "of", "agricultural", "practices", "to", "address", "the", "negative", "impact", "of", "climate", "change", ".", "This", "is", "consistent", "with", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "expressed", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9396966099739075, 0.9343332648277283, 0.9999978542327881, 0.6937198042869568, 0.6486561894416809, 0.9967297315597534, 0.9999713897705078, 0.9999904632568359, 0.998136579990387, 0.8601816296577454, 0.8713605999946594, 0.549129843711853, 0.9998175501823425, 0.5772174596786499, 0.9993242025375366, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9957443475723267, 0.9999908208847046, 0.9971820712089539, 0.9998577237129211, 0.9996973276138306, 0.9999973177909851, 0.99982750415802, 0.44955959916114807, 0.3598063290119171, 0.4187956750392914, 0.9473347067832947, 0.9213464260101318, 0.8938753008842468, 0.9121600985527039, 0.6098030805587769, 0.995356559753418, 0.6791648268699646, 0.9998672604560852, 0.9998899102210999, 0.41734689474105835, 0.8522849678993225, 0.36048102378845215, 0.9830703139305115, 0.7545930743217468, 0.9985607266426086, 0.9980459809303284, 0.4739578068256378, 0.9999996423721313, 0.5506277680397034, 0.8961328864097595, 0.9764370918273926, 0.4755787253379822, 0.9999943971633911, 0.8457386493682861, 0.7956796288490295, 0.9392439723014832, 0.33719950914382935, 0.3034011423587799, 0.9091524481773376, 0.33708104491233826, 0.9523838758468628, 0.800148069858551, 0.49233052134513855, 0.765251874923706, 0.9999929666519165, 0.30930978059768677, 0.8302853107452393, 0.9947029948234558, 0.9628350138664246, 0.7865698933601379, 0.9999974966049194, 0.9940543174743652, 0.9277815818786621, 0.9902889728546143, 0.8794494271278381, 0.9999977350234985, 1.0, 0.9998255372047424, 0.9888808727264404, 0.9999852180480957, 0.9809954166412354, 0.9996341466903687, 0.9999938607215881, 0.9999989867210388, 0.5897858142852783, 0.29336726665496826, 0.9999990463256836, 0.5661874413490295, 0.16674281656742096, 0.45781195163726807, 0.951505184173584, 0.999993085861206, 0.9585233926773071, 0.9999546408653259, 0.9971816539764404, 0.9999287128448486, 0.9995105862617493, 0.9999974966049194, 0.8551734089851379, 0.31804829835891724, 0.9527240991592407, 0.34426313638687134, 0.9613580703735352, 0.35939085483551025, 0.4484798312187195, 0.9399247765541077, 0.5292602181434631, 0.7558131814002991, 0.9972367286682129, 0.41585826873779297, 0.49371960759162903, 0.4561951160430908, 0.9465927481651306, 0.6950415968894958, 0.45624488592147827, 0.7108328342437744, 0.3788130283355713, 0.8012909889221191, 0.7519327998161316, 0.5264357328414917, 0.8386117815971375, 0.9038097262382507, 0.496882826089859, 0.8764112591743469, 0.9988385438919067, 0.9810464382171631, 0.9994307160377502, 0.8902352452278137, 0.26750460267066956, 0.36862704157829285, 0.74781733751297, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9998044967651367, 0.7798202037811279, 0.9026466012001038, 0.6186991333961487, 0.9990460276603699, 0.9975876212120056, 0.9816292524337769, 0.99209064245224, 0.6114318370819092, 0.910755455493927]}

Additionally, the positive sentiment of some background knowledge, such as the importance of protecting the environment and promoting sustainable agriculture, further supports the positive polarity classification.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Pos", "itive", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "in", "order", "to", "make", "the", "world", "aware", "'", "indicates", "an", "intent", "to", "inform", "and", "educ", "ate", "the", "public", "about", "a", "problem", ".", "Given", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "of", "the", "background", "knowledge", ",", "it", "is", "important", "to", "note", "that", "the", "creation", "of", "the", "International", "Day", "for", "A", "ware", "ness", "of", "Food", "Loss", "and", "W", "aste", "is", "a", "pro", "active", "step", "towards", "addressing", "this", "issue", ".", "By", "increasing", "awareness", ",", "individuals", "and", "communities", "can", "take", "actions", "to", "reduce", "food", "waste", "and", "improve", "food", "security", ".", "Additionally", ",", "the", "positive", "sentiment", "of", "some", "background", "knowledge", ",", "such", "as", "the", "importance", "of", "protecting", "the", "environment", "and", "promoting", "sustainable", "agriculture", ",", "further", "supports", "the", "positive", "pol", "arity", "classification", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8881891369819641, 0.9541559815406799, 0.9999616742134094, 0.7289198040962219, 0.5191166400909424, 0.9999865293502808, 0.9999886155128479, 0.9998343586921692, 0.7071893811225891, 0.8193199038505554, 0.6054326891899109, 0.9998332262039185, 0.6689148545265198, 0.9968827962875366, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999874830245972, 0.9999982118606567, 0.999996542930603, 0.9998751282691956, 0.9996356964111328, 0.43553683161735535, 0.5841548442840576, 0.4184799790382385, 0.9458087086677551, 0.8533003330230713, 0.6642277240753174, 0.5690556168556213, 1.0, 0.42515829205513, 0.8161125183105469, 0.8607325553894043, 0.40144234895706177, 0.644161581993103, 0.5759361982345581, 0.27082207798957825, 0.9135481119155884, 0.6804351806640625, 0.3727612793445587, 0.3582434356212616, 0.9494385123252869, 0.9389601349830627, 0.7733945846557617, 0.6191688179969788, 0.7423649430274963, 0.25827571749687195, 0.5315977334976196, 0.9931555986404419, 0.7774723768234253, 0.9963697791099548, 0.5931096076965332, 0.30028125643730164, 0.9947759509086609, 0.406474232673645, 0.9935315251350403, 0.999960720539093, 0.9999666810035706, 0.9979596138000488, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9999686479568481, 0.9999944567680359, 0.9999734163284302, 0.9999979138374329, 0.9999855756759644, 0.9999973773956299, 0.9207663536071777, 0.8957864046096802, 0.5314769744873047, 0.9998574256896973, 0.48361867666244507, 0.4208765923976898, 0.9898778796195984, 0.35776907205581665, 0.47892916202545166, 0.8614473342895508, 0.3538099527359009, 0.32712340354919434, 0.9657516479492188, 0.8569547533988953, 0.594656229019165, 0.8245909214019775, 0.9496341943740845, 0.9708094000816345, 0.7483139038085938, 0.5711758732795715, 0.9920223355293274, 0.9821301698684692, 0.9810367822647095, 0.9463053941726685, 0.7974103093147278, 0.6402333974838257, 0.575107216835022, 0.6701546907424927, 0.5237961411476135, 0.35843685269355774, 0.9999992251396179, 0.7923195958137512, 0.7820841073989868, 0.8406680822372437, 0.8453162312507629, 0.2887584865093231, 0.9235936999320984, 0.9328983426094055, 0.4092883765697479, 0.916125476360321, 0.9999982118606567, 0.9431710243225098, 0.9766219854354858, 0.9999895095825195, 0.7871078252792358, 0.9999934434890747, 0.9999976754188538, 0.8515705466270447, 0.6299466490745544, 0.9999685883522034, 0.8877061605453491, 0.99982750415802, 0.740398108959198, 0.8162260055541992, 0.9231409430503845, 0.6684994697570801, 0.5769373178482056, 0.9999989867210388, 0.7749677300453186, 0.947495698928833, 0.8827095627784729]}

The negative sentiment towards GMOs in the background knowledge also supports this classification, as the production of bioweapons is often associated with the manipulation and weaponization of living organisms.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "term", "'", "bi", "owe", "ap", "ons", "'", "carries", "a", "negative", "con", "notation", ",", "as", "it", "refers", "to", "the", "use", "of", "living", "organ", "isms", "or", "their", "to", "x", "ins", "as", "weapons", ".", "The", "text", "ment", "ions", "that", "'", "most", "countries", "have", "bi", "ol", "abs", "which", "are", "used", "for", "everything", "from", "g", "mo", "development", "to", "ins", "ulin", "production", "and", "vaccine", "development", "'.", "However", ",", "the", "mention", "of", "'", "bi", "owe", "ap", "ons", "l", "abs", "'", "in", "the", "same", "context", "implies", "that", "some", "of", "these", "l", "abs", "may", "be", "used", "for", "ne", "far", "ious", "purposes", ",", "such", "as", "the", "production", "of", "biological", "weapons", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "G", "MO", "s", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", "also", "supports", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "the", "production", "of", "bi", "owe", "ap", "ons", "is", "often", "associated", "with", "the", "manip", "ulation", "and", "weapon", "ization", "of", "living", "organ", "isms", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7783352136611938, 0.9248251914978027, 0.9999986290931702, 0.7159989476203918, 0.8491616249084473, 0.9944382905960083, 0.9999731183052063, 0.9999955296516418, 0.9986399412155151, 0.8430051803588867, 0.8830007910728455, 0.46393486857414246, 0.9706002473831177, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9999622106552124, 0.9999250769615173, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9320809245109558, 0.5234906673431396, 0.9154512882232666, 0.6188438534736633, 0.9309719204902649, 0.9999821186065674, 0.38239920139312744, 0.652845025062561, 0.7804123163223267, 0.6613587737083435, 0.9994834065437317, 0.6438008546829224, 0.8862209916114807, 0.9995031952857971, 0.4825989305973053, 0.9995092749595642, 0.9999966025352478, 0.8254231214523315, 0.8914791941642761, 0.7671328186988831, 0.9999983906745911, 0.9999546408653259, 0.6837512254714966, 0.995914876461029, 0.6015850901603699, 0.6314520239830017, 0.30554017424583435, 0.5145690441131592, 1.0, 0.37299227714538574, 0.3377677798271179, 0.9782574772834778, 0.9999300837516785, 0.9577346444129944, 0.9996936917304993, 0.9999947547912598, 0.9999686479568481, 0.796981692314148, 0.9994423985481262, 0.9999829530715942, 0.999279260635376, 0.9935739636421204, 0.8806182146072388, 0.946121335029602, 0.9999670386314392, 0.9994286298751831, 0.993653416633606, 0.9999443292617798, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9999542832374573, 0.9986634850502014, 0.9999738335609436, 0.9998690485954285, 0.38477832078933716, 0.7039413452148438, 0.9999337792396545, 0.6077262163162231, 0.1765936315059662, 0.9980483055114746, 0.9507433176040649, 0.9998196363449097, 0.9999762177467346, 0.9999818205833435, 1.0, 0.8171462416648865, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9908211827278137, 0.6109407544136047, 0.9531610608100891, 0.864789605140686, 0.796512246131897, 0.31279319524765015, 0.8186919689178467, 0.628054678440094, 0.7872295379638672, 0.9989086985588074, 0.6717953681945801, 0.9999986886978149, 0.8885538578033447, 0.7939707040786743, 0.9645149111747742, 0.9989070296287537, 0.41964447498321533, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9978429675102234, 0.8569608330726624, 0.7778596878051758, 0.999996542930603, 0.7566016316413879, 0.6680533289909363, 0.9983397126197815, 0.7771931886672974, 0.9941734671592712, 0.983301043510437, 0.5693833827972412, 0.751679539680481, 0.7727299928665161, 0.2859153151512146, 0.6770038604736328, 0.9999957084655762, 0.9520905613899231, 0.5314157009124756, 0.9936195611953735, 0.9951325058937073, 0.9986153841018677, 0.7906308174133301, 0.7310265898704529, 0.8159589767456055, 0.6678325533866882, 0.5915786623954773, 0.9900285601615906, 0.668025553226471, 0.44897791743278503, 0.6510359644889832, 0.5547730922698975, 0.9996688365936279, 0.9999822974205017, 0.9999964237213135, 0.3884473443031311, 0.6685535311698914, 0.8896930813789368, 0.9999905228614807, 0.8040096163749695, 0.46371665596961975, 0.9999933838844299, 0.651326060295105, 0.2916702628135681, 0.9996066093444824, 0.9999996423721313, 0.7706246376037598, 0.9999768137931824, 0.9999957084655762, 0.6731594204902649, 0.7533411979675293]}

In this context, the speaker mentions that they were on a plant-based diet for health reasons, but protein intake was not a concern for them. However, the background knowledge suggests that protein intake can be a concern for individuals following plant-based diets, as it can be more challenging to obtain sufficient protein from plant sources compared to animal products. The negative sentiment in the background knowledge also reinforces the idea that there can be challenges or issues associated with plant-based diets. Therefore, the use of the word 'concern' in the target phrase indicates a negative sentiment towards the speaker's experience with their plant-based diet.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "word", "'", "conc", "ern", "'", "in", "the", "target", "phrase", "implies", "that", "there", "was", "an", "issue", "or", "problem", "that", "the", "speaker", "was", "aware", "of", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "speaker", "ment", "ions", "that", "they", "were", "on", "a", "plant", "-", "based", "diet", "for", "health", "reasons", ",", "but", "protein", "int", "ake", "was", "not", "a", "concern", "for", "them", ".", "However", ",", "the", "background", "knowledge", "suggests", "that", "protein", "int", "ake", "can", "be", "a", "concern", "for", "individuals", "following", "plant", "-", "based", "di", "ets", ",", "as", "it", "can", "be", "more", "challenging", "to", "obtain", "sufficient", "protein", "from", "plant", "sources", "compared", "to", "animal", "products", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", "also", "rein", "for", "ces", "the", "idea", "that", "there", "can", "be", "challenges", "or", "issues", "associated", "with", "plant", "-", "based", "di", "ets", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "use", "of", "the", "word", "'", "conc", "ern", "'", "in", "the", "target", "phrase", "indicates", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "speaker", "'", "s", "experience", "with", "their", "plant", "-", "based", "diet", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9359713196754456, 0.8023448586463928, 0.999998152256012, 0.8165615797042847, 0.4948667287826538, 0.992472767829895, 0.9999614357948303, 0.999839723110199, 0.9968922138214111, 0.8945130705833435, 0.6917557716369629, 0.25360971689224243, 0.9701396822929382, 0.9765912890434265, 0.999996542930603, 0.9982616901397705, 0.5360788702964783, 0.674980878829956, 0.41521331667900085, 0.9737058877944946, 0.15123537182807922, 0.6387427449226379, 0.665165364742279, 0.7615892887115479, 0.5521911978721619, 0.9991732835769653, 0.9537862539291382, 0.8988341689109802, 0.35661590099334717, 0.832879900932312, 0.9860679507255554, 0.3993193507194519, 0.3991304636001587, 0.9996606111526489, 0.48401907086372375, 0.4203692376613617, 0.6458784341812134, 0.9176719784736633, 0.999485433101654, 0.5103647112846375, 0.5769829750061035, 0.47715476155281067, 0.9999987483024597, 0.7400034666061401, 0.7487872838973999, 0.8548939228057861, 0.33200448751449585, 0.9999598860740662, 0.9729329943656921, 0.9963883757591248, 0.999826967716217, 0.9823231101036072, 0.7445986866950989, 0.9973034262657166, 0.9994029998779297, 0.520984411239624, 0.6993948817253113, 0.3955465257167816, 0.9998804330825806, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9587873816490173, 0.9020217061042786, 0.9920318126678467, 0.9977413415908813, 0.9225380420684814, 0.9998365640640259, 0.9887071847915649, 0.4513795077800751, 0.9999877214431763, 0.4620029628276825, 0.6546937823295593, 0.9290784001350403, 0.41733741760253906, 0.9537892937660217, 0.38747790455818176, 0.9985049962997437, 0.9999978542327881, 0.5714760422706604, 0.9566810131072998, 0.8902270197868347, 0.5968934297561646, 0.7770893573760986, 0.6614140272140503, 0.7485308647155762, 0.6469749808311462, 0.999946117401123, 0.9998360872268677, 0.9984403252601624, 0.9999999403953552, 0.5446422696113586, 0.6941856145858765, 0.650766134262085, 0.4589993953704834, 0.9883321523666382, 0.7952808737754822, 0.9320913553237915, 0.999422013759613, 0.8774604201316833, 0.6604434847831726, 0.7888301610946655, 0.9541813135147095, 0.9448992013931274, 0.9668490290641785, 0.5021377205848694, 0.9999899864196777, 0.9970511794090271, 0.9007104635238647, 0.9965903759002686, 0.3875897526741028, 0.9173036813735962, 0.7980234026908875, 0.7514336705207825, 0.9813599586486816, 0.9968087077140808, 0.9528136849403381, 0.545332133769989, 0.2513630986213684, 0.999997079372406, 0.9999995231628418, 0.5880073308944702, 0.7160036563873291, 0.9933034181594849, 0.7897248864173889, 0.4501112401485443, 0.9887508749961853, 0.5889715552330017, 0.8045697808265686, 0.470525860786438, 0.61976158618927, 0.9999974966049194, 0.7646642327308655, 0.9999659657478333, 0.9999768137931824, 0.9993374943733215, 0.9999995231628418, 0.48810356855392456, 0.7812637090682983, 0.9999969005584717, 0.8932168483734131, 0.3844795823097229, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9940827488899231, 0.9938915371894836, 0.9999725818634033, 0.9980307817459106, 0.9999986290931702, 0.999957263469696, 0.960841953754425, 0.8960850238800049, 0.7700344324111938, 0.999304473400116, 0.2786949872970581, 0.9958523511886597, 0.9113487601280212, 0.5808702111244202, 0.8493393659591675, 0.9940319061279297, 0.3879397213459015, 0.9999144077301025, 0.9999989867210388, 0.7228310108184814, 0.7968514561653137, 0.38856032490730286, 0.9396385550498962, 0.9999931454658508, 0.99997878074646, 0.9996801018714905, 0.8974255919456482, 0.9848540425300598]}

Therefore, the negative sentiment towards the inability to reuse secondary books is consistent with the overall message of the background knowledge.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "can", "not", "be", "re", "used", "'", "implies", "that", "the", "secondary", "books", "cannot", "be", "used", "again", "after", "they", "have", "been", "read", "or", "owned", ".", "This", "is", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "as", "it", "suggests", "that", "these", "books", "are", "not", "being", "put", "to", "good", "use", "and", "are", "being", "disc", "arded", ",", "which", "is", "not", "sustainable", "or", "environment", "ally", "friendly", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "does", "not", "directly", "relate", "to", "the", "target", "phrase", ",", "but", "it", "does", "emphas", "ize", "the", "importance", "of", "reducing", ",", "re", "using", ",", "and", "recycl", "ing", "to", "protect", "the", "environment", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "in", "ability", "to", "re", "use", "secondary", "books", "is", "consistent", "with", "the", "overall", "message", "of", "the", "background", "knowledge", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7694505453109741, 0.9276191592216492, 0.9999992251396179, 0.3773709833621979, 0.5585981011390686, 0.9963628053665161, 0.9999638199806213, 0.9999535083770752, 0.9979693293571472, 0.8278853297233582, 0.715256929397583, 0.3869071900844574, 0.9995719194412231, 0.7095990777015686, 0.9322962164878845, 0.9999894499778748, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9999986290931702, 0.999139130115509, 0.2906489074230194, 0.8642316460609436, 0.4227987825870514, 0.36694127321243286, 0.9999759793281555, 0.41681671142578125, 0.9837110638618469, 0.49511954188346863, 0.9744020104408264, 0.34729015827178955, 0.32707273960113525, 0.9774473905563354, 0.992039144039154, 0.3535423278808594, 0.5576921105384827, 0.47374463081359863, 0.4051973819732666, 0.5785485506057739, 0.5542705059051514, 0.5948367118835449, 0.6278066039085388, 0.38892731070518494, 0.47352561354637146, 0.9244229197502136, 0.6082254648208618, 0.46501973271369934, 0.49378877878189087, 0.9914555549621582, 0.4416691064834595, 0.4829387962818146, 0.3238546848297119, 0.42166629433631897, 0.9756366014480591, 0.8916010856628418, 0.9994442462921143, 0.4901902675628662, 0.5770393013954163, 0.28887706995010376, 0.9060376286506653, 0.9999902844429016, 0.3678116798400879, 0.38466235995292664, 0.3919063210487366, 0.6253073811531067, 0.271360844373703, 0.46859318017959595, 0.61119145154953, 0.9991918206214905, 0.9854577779769897, 0.985183596611023, 0.4045739471912384, 0.6170645356178284, 0.941328763961792, 0.48257046937942505, 0.986842930316925, 0.4852796792984009, 0.2915782928466797, 0.999988853931427, 0.8437083959579468, 0.7004011273384094, 0.9977068901062012, 0.5864134430885315, 0.9862256050109863, 0.6424815654754639, 0.6491535305976868, 0.3878572881221771, 0.999858558177948, 0.999761700630188, 0.9978899359703064, 0.9999240040779114, 0.8790399432182312, 0.5053844451904297, 0.9998849034309387, 0.9999105334281921, 0.9953902959823608, 0.9999976754188538, 0.9998100996017456, 1.0, 0.4854132831096649, 0.6266180276870728, 0.9998975396156311, 0.9999909996986389, 0.5862435102462769, 0.31429627537727356, 0.999983549118042, 0.9508405923843384, 0.711570680141449, 0.7070263028144836, 0.5902592539787292, 0.7678707242012024, 0.6959851980209351, 0.9999896287918091, 0.9957863688468933, 0.9991730451583862, 0.9999904632568359, 0.8641992807388306, 0.9999803900718689, 0.8697882890701294, 0.42100176215171814, 0.9999857544898987, 0.9638225436210632, 0.42167240381240845, 0.5540007948875427, 0.8805618286132812, 0.6661806106567383, 0.9760291576385498, 0.997012197971344, 0.9082616567611694, 0.9923813939094543]}
