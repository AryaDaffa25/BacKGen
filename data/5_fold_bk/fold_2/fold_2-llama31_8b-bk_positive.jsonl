The reason is that it reduces waste and promotes sustainability.  This is because it involves reusing and recycling materials, rather than simply dumping them in the ground.  This approach is desirable because it minimizes harm to the environment and conserves natural resources.  Therefore, it is a positive act.  In the same way, better carbon sinks are also a positive outcome because they help to control global weather patterns and mitigate the effects of climate change.  This is achieved through the use of genetically modified plants and other innovative technologies.  These technologies have the potential to create a more sustainable future and promote environmental stewardship.  Similarly, optimum water management and reuse are also positive outcomes because they help to conserve this vital resource and promote sustainable development.  This is achieved through the use of advanced technologies and innovative policies.  These approaches are desirable because they minimize waste and promote environmental sustainability.  Therefore, they are positive acts.  In contrast, a no-defense system is not a positive outcome because it leaves individuals and communities vulnerable to harm.  This is because it does not provide adequate protection or security.  Therefore, it is not a desirable outcome.

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  '' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  'Hawke's Bay winery doubled in size last year.'  'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP's like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   '' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  '(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  '(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  '(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.' '(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  '(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP \"turbot catches\" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  '*Turbot increased in catches.'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  '(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to \"the people\", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  '(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP \"the population of Smallville\" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer \"of Smallville\" is tagged as Item.   '(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' '(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  '(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  '(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.' '(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.'  There is no Attribute \"1999 price\" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as \"price\" on the 2nd layer.

'They were arguing on screen .' 'Watching chess is pretty low on my list .'  The use of on.prep to describe use of a vehicle is not included in this frame even though it does involve contact and support. The sense distinction is proven by the omissability of the Ground only in the vehicle cases: 'She is already on (the bus/the ship...) .' 'My paper is on *(the desk) .' This use is related to Ride_vehicle.  A similar argument holds for uses of on.prep with a clothing Figure, which virtually always omits the Ground; see Wearing.

'Social' here encompasses entities that are economic, political, technological, historical, cultural, and intimate: 'The private sector is so much more dynamic.' 'Singh had been under intense political pressure.' 'Economies are still sluggish.' Relatedly, the influential effect of an psychological entity is described in terms of energy exertion by a physical entity. 'Psychological' includes the intellectual, emotional, and creative: 'Sinead's emotional intensity permeates every nuance of every lyric.' 'He finds the Poet Laureate's theory about Shakespeare to be more energetic than persuasive.' Both metaphors appear to involve a third metaphor, which is the anthropomorphization of processes (see examples directly above) or inhuman entities (e.g. in nature): 'The lazy creak of sails' 'The energetic waves' 'A broad, lethargic river'  Further, there is a metonymy wherein energy exerted by people carrying out an activity characterizes instead a central object or other component of the activity: 'Lucker plays lazy games.' 'She thought the lazy days in France would never end.'  '' Compare to: Level_of_force_exertion.

The second sentence is associated with the frame \"Dynamism\" because the Lexical Unit \"intensity\" is exerting energy at a level specified by the target (emission), which is a \"Force\".

Though on a conceptual level these words always attribute mental properties to people, they may be applied to Protagonist's Behaviors as well, with the understanding that the Behavior is revealing a (usually temporary) property of the Protagonist responsible for it. For example, while we may speak of a stupid person, we may also speak of a stupid thing to say/do/think. In addition, we may mention both the Protagonist and the Behavior, as in 'It was stupid of me to do that.' Some of the words in this frame also have slightly different uses, in which there is a constituent expressing the Practice with respect to which the mental property holds of the Protagonist, as in:       'She is astute at math.' While Practice expressions do not co-occur with Behavior expressions, they seem sufficiently different semantically to warrant a distinct frame element (FE) name. Also, while the FE Behavior usually occurs in sentences expressing judgments that are based on specific events, Practice occurs in sentences that are about general capabilities. In addition to the frame elements which are expressed, there is an understood judge (usually the speaker) in the background who forms the opinion of the Protagonist's mental properties, judging the Protagonist or the Protagonist's Behavior to be stupid, brilliant, etc.  "], ["Hindering", "In this frame a Hindrance makes it more difficult for a Protagonist to complete their intended Action or a Hindrance directly affects an Action where the Action can be a natural act or the actions of many individuals in a collective endeavor.

In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus \"glinting\", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a \"hard cold\" emotion like hatred, while \"sparkling\", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a \"beautiful\" emotion like amusement or excitement.

The change is usually assumed to be an improvement for the Entity. Because this frame is describing change according to some known model of the Entity, the Prior_state and Post_state are backgrounded, and often implicit.  'Their offensive armament has developed from short range missiles to long-range ballistic weaponry in a relatively short period .' 'The maturation of warhead technology is, perhaps, not far off .' 'Recovery in our major overseas markets has progressed tentatively and increased spending by consumers and government does not appear to be benefiting this' 'Why have we developed economically as we have?'  This frame is not equivalent to the frame Improvement_or_decline for two reasons.  Firstly, Progression implies a smooth or multi-stage change involving several different states of the Entity in an expected sequence, while Improvement_or_decline may be simple or complex, in accord with an expected sequence or not.  Secondly, progression along an expected sequence does not necessarily mean that things get better (or worse) for the Entity.  This is clear in the case of progression of a disease, since different ailments have very different expected sequenes, with initial onset leading to expected disappearance (for cases like the cold), or to permanent impairment (in the case of Parkinsons), or to death (in many forms of cancer).  However, it is more confusing in the very common case of the progress of a biological Entity from birth to death, where this frame often emphasizes the phases of the lifespan where the organism increases in ability, thus reaching a more desirable state.  Plans are also spoken of as progressions, and because the expected sequence is towards the goal of the agents that formed the plan, these uses of the progress frame also emphasize improvement. "], ["Required_event", "Unless a particular Required_situation obtains, Negative_consequences will follow.  Alternatively, the Required_situation is required to achieve a Purpose (which avoids Negative_consequences). A set of Circumstances may be specified under which the requirement holds.  'You must turn in your test by 5 p.m.' 'You better have that fixed by tomorrow or else we'll fire you.' 'The book needs to be shorter to sell to such a young audience.'  Most, but not all, LUs of this frame are usable in a context that implies a duty or responsibility, concepts related to the Being_obligated frame. However, our analysis is that such interpretations are due to contextual pragmatic strengthening--in other words, a duty is a frequently salient type of purpose that has negative consequences if not achieved."], ["Reading_activity", "A Reader visually examines a Text, typically in a linear order, to understand its content.  In place of the Text, a Topic may be mentioned.  'She ca n't read . INI' 'They read the bible nightly .' 'I 've read about you !'  '' This frame differs from the Reading_perception frame, which obligatorily focuses on the perceptual and cognitive interpretive aspects of reading; unlike Reading_activity, targets in Reading_perception require explicit mention of the Text being examined.  While Reading_activity is broad enough to cover the same circumstances as Reading_perception, it also covers situations where reading is contrasted merely with another task or leisure activity, when reading is considered generically, and when the Topic unifying the reading activity replaces mention of a Text. '' Additionally, this frame differs from Hearsay in that Reading_activity is focused on what the Reader is agentively doing, whereas in Hearsay, the focus is on what the Hearer knows and how they know it.  As a result, most valences are unambiguous: full clause complements for the Message point to the Hearsay frame, while Text or lack of any complement indicates the Reading_activity frame.  The only overlap is in the case of Topic, where the frames can be still distinguished by factivity of the Topic.  In other words, read.v used in the Hearsay frame, just like hear.v in the Hearsay frame, when used with a Topic, indicates clearly that there is some specific fact related to the Topic that the reader or hearer now knows and understands. Thus the first and second of the following sentences belong to Hearsay, the last to Reading_activity: 'Yes, I read about how you won teacher of the year .' 'I just read about the accident .' '' 'I was reading about dinosaurs all day.'   "], ["Change_position_on_a_scale", "This frame consists of words that indicate the change of an Item's position on a scale (the Attribute) from a starting point (Initial_value) to an end point (Final_value). The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  '' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  'Hawke's Bay winery doubled in size last year.'  'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP's like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   '' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  '(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  '(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  '(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.' '(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  '(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP \"turbot catches\" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  '*Turbot increased in catches.'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  '(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to \"the people\", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  '(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP \"the population of Smallville\" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer \"of Smallville\" is tagged as Item.   '(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' '(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  '(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  '(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.' '(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.'  There is no Attribute \"1999 price\" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as \"price\" on the 2nd layer.

The change is usually assumed to be an improvement for the Entity. Because this frame is describing change according to some known model of the Entity, the Prior_state and Post_state are backgrounded, and often implicit.  'Their offensive armament has developed from short range missiles to long-range ballistic weaponry in a relatively short period .' 'The maturation of warhead technology is, perhaps, not far off .' 'Recovery in our major overseas markets has progressed tentatively and increased spending by consumers and government does not appear to be benefiting this' 'Why have we developed economically as we have?'  This frame is not equivalent to the frame Improvement_or_decline for two reasons.  Firstly, Progression implies a smooth or multi-stage change involving several different states of the Entity in an expected sequence, while Improvement_or_decline may be simple or complex, in accord with an expected sequence or not.  Secondly, progression along an expected sequence does not necessarily mean that things get better (or worse) for the Entity.  This is clear in the case of progression of a disease, since different ailments have very different expected sequenes, with initial onset leading to expected disappearance (for cases like the cold), or to permanent impairment (in the case of Parkinsons), or to death (in many forms of cancer).  However, it is more confusing in the very common case of the progress of a biological Entity from birth to death, where this frame often emphasizes the phases of the lifespan where the organism increases in ability, thus reaching a more desirable state.  Plans are also spoken of as progressions, and because the expected sequence is towards the goal of the agents that formed the plan, these uses of the progress frame also emphasize improvement.

When attention is focused on a Salient_entity, then mention of a global Experience is excluded and typically, but not always, either a State or Impression of the Salient_entity is presented.  '' Episodic memory is the  explicit memory of events. It includes time, place, and associated emotions (which affect the quality of the memorization). Episodic memory contrasts and interacts with semantic memory, the memory of facts and concepts. The Remembering_information frame is concerned with this latter type of memory.   'Kozmo could remember when his modem was the fastest he could buy.'  'That's probably before my time, which was long time ago, Fish may remember that time.'

Though on a conceptual level these words always attribute mental properties to people, they may be applied to Protagonist's Behaviors as well, with the understanding that the Behavior is revealing a (usually temporary) property of the Protagonist responsible for it. For example, while we may speak of a stupid person, we may also speak of a stupid thing to say/do/think. In addition, we may mention both the Protagonist and the Behavior, as in 'It was stupid of me to do that.' Some of the words in this frame also have slightly different uses, in which there is a constituent expressing the Practice with respect to which the mental property holds of the Protagonist, as in:       'She is astute at math.' While Practice expressions do not co-occur with Behavior expressions, they seem sufficiently different semantically to warrant a distinct frame element (FE) name. Also, while the FE Behavior usually occurs in sentences expressing judgments that are based on specific events, Practice occurs in sentences that are about general capabilities. In addition to the frame elements which are expressed, there is an understood judge (usually the speaker) in the background who forms the opinion of the Protagonist's mental properties, judging the Protagonist or the Protagonist's Behavior to be stupid, brilliant, etc.  "]], "original_answer": " It is good to see that some places are working towards a better future. \n\nNote: The input sentences are grouped by shared situations (or frames) modeled according to Frame Semantics Theory.

''  In both of these light-related frames, there is a very consistent metaphorical conception of emotions as shining in eyes or forth from eyes, including the associated pattern of eyes shining with an emotion.  The sense in such cases is that the eyes (or the muscles and features around the eyes) are in such a configuration as to saliently convey an emotion.  In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus \"glinting\", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a \"hard cold\" emotion like hatred, while \"sparkling\", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a \"beautiful\" emotion like amusement or excitement.

A Means  has been created or is used to allow the creator or a user to achieve a  Goal. The Goal is a state of the world that does not currently hold but which the Agent wants to realize and is planning and/or working towards. In some cases, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase metonymically stands for the Agent or the Means (e.g. The goal [of this paper/seminar/project] is to determine ...). We mark these phrases as Agent on the first layer but also annotate them as Means on a second annotation layer.  In some cases a Restrictor on the Goal state of affairs can be given prominence as a separate constituent. Talking about Goals frequently includes the mention of a Domain to which the Agent's Goal is relevant.  'The modest American goal of a threefold increase in capacity recognises this fact .'

The Negated_proposition and the Factual_situation share non-focal content, on the basis of which they correspond, and contrast in a subset of their content, the focal content, established with reference to a set of focus constructions not described here.  (The focus of negation is often conveyed intonationally in spoken English; in text, however, negative focus must be derived inferentially from contextual reference. A subset of focus constructions will be annotated in the constructicon.)  '' While the semantics of negation are quite different from the semantics belonging to most frames, at a minimum, our modeling of the concept using frame semantic tools can be viewed as a practical attempt to label a problem and annotate examples that may inform further research. '' Negation can be evoked verbally (analytic or synthetic) or nominally. Negators include \"not\", \"no\", \"never\", and negational affixes, such as those used on inflected verbs in synthetic verbal negation (wasn't, isn't, haven't).  'It 's not far from here .

The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).      "], ["Temporal_collocation", "A Trajector is identified as occurring at the same time as some better-known Landmark.  We consider sequenced calendric units (e.g. Tuesday, 1987, January) as periods for the purposes of this frame.  Some lexical items allow certain types of frame elements while disallowing others (e.g. *During Tuesday...).

'He did it then.'"]], "original_answer": " We can achieve a better future for the planet by making sustainable choices. \n\nThe final answer is: We can achieve a better future for the planet by making sustainable choices. \nReason: The generated sentence conveys a positive sentiment because it implies that the future will be better, which is a desirable outcome. The reason for this sentiment is that the sentence is based on the idea that making sustainable choices will lead to a positive outcome, which is a widely accepted and desirable goal. \n\nNote: The generated sentence is a general statement that reflects stereotypical information about the importance of making sustainable choices for a better future. It does not require specific knowledge of the input sentences, but rather general knowledge about the topic. The reason for the positive sentiment is made explicit in the sentence itself, which emphasizes the idea that making sustainable choices will lead to a better future. \n\nAlso, note that the input sentences are grouped by shared situations (or frames) modeled according to Frame Semantics Theory. Each input sentence explicitly indicates the Lexical Unit (evoking the frames) and the corresponding role. The definitions of the frames are provided to guide the generation of the sentence. The generated sentence conveys a positive sentiment and the reason for this sentiment is made explicit. \n\nLet", "list_subtoken": [" We", " can", " achieve", " a", " better", " future", " for", "

This frame includes only actions that are initiated by the Donor (the one that starts out owning the Theme).  Sentences (even metaphorical ones) must meet the following entailments: the  Donor first has possession of the Theme.  Following the transfer the Donor no longer has the Theme and the Recipient does. 'Barney gave the beer to Moe.' '$300 was endowed to the university to build a new performing arts building.'"], ["Desiring", "An Experiencer desires that an Event occur.  (Note that commonly a resultant state of the Event will stand in for the Event.)  In some cases, the Experiencer is an active participant in the Event, and in such cases the Event itself is often not mentioned, but rather some Focal_participant which is subordinately involved in the Event. ''Generally, the use of a word in this frame implies that the specific Event has not yet happened, but that the Experiencer believes that they would be happier if it did.  Sometimes the Time_of_event, Purpose_of_event, or the Location_of_event are mentioned without the explicit mention of the Event. 'I only wanted one piece of candy.' 'The company was eager for him to leave as soon as possible.' 'Susan really wishes that you 'd listen to her.'"], ["Presentation_of_mitigation", "A  Mitigating_situation is presented as occurring against the backdrop of a more preferable situation and a less preferable situation that, while expected, feared, or hoped for, did not or will not occur; the Mitigating_situation is thus, so to speak, sandwiched between a better and a worse situation, both of which are relevant in the discourse. Understanding the Mitigating_situation is therefore dependent on understanding the better and the worse situations, one or the other or both of which normally have already been mentioned or strongly evoked in the discourse. The relation of the Mitigating_situation to these situations may be filled in by discourse-level inference, as in the first example below, or implied by contrastive intonation, as in the second example.   'At least I don\u2019t have to go to school.'  'Ava, anyway, knew who he was.'  When the Mitigating_situation clause involves a negation, like in the first example above, the non-negated form is generally taken to be the worse situation - potentially also in combination with previous discourse context. (i.e. Perhaps there's been a blizzard.  The better situation is that a blizzard did not occur.  The mitigating situation is that a blizzard occurred, but I don't have to go to school.  The worse situation would be that a blizzard occurred, and I also have to go to school.) '' Targets in this frame frequently occur in constructions that obscure the full 'Mitigating_situation:'  'There will be no exceptions -- not for you, at any rate.' In this example, there is a fragment ellipsis construction that depends on the semantics of the immediately preceding context. '' Lexical Units of this frame also frequently occur with the use of or that conveys a speaker self-correction or hedge. The function of this sort of or is to introduce contradictory possibilities without endorsing any of them.  In combination with targets of the Presentation_of_mitigation frame, or joins a clause that represents the better situation to a second clause (or fragment) marked with an LU of this frame, with the overall intent of saying that even the less preferable alternative is still suitable to carry forward the point that the speaker wishes to express: 'She traveled, and now she is back here to transform our drab little lives, or at any rate, our drab furniture.' '' The humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab.  Note that this example, and most examples involving or, occur with the Shared_completion construction, meaning that two parts of the sentence have to be annotated: the shared part of the first clause and a fragment directly marked with a Presentation_of_mitigation LU. '' This frame is to be distinguished from two related frames, Concessive and Conditional_scenario. In Concessive and its daughter frames, either a Main_assertion or a Conceded_state_of_affairs FE (or both) are present, and both FEs, even though seemingly contradictory, are simulateously true. Here, however, only the Mitigating_situation actually occurs. Targets in this frame may be embedded in larger Concessive constructions, such as the below with although, where the better situation is made explicit (in negated form): 'Although she\u2019s not my favorite, a new actress has won this time in any case.'   In Conditional_scenario, a Profiled_possibility and its Consequence, as well as an Opposite_possibility and its Anti_consequence, can be presented. Neither of the possibilities is asserted as true, nor is a desirability scale with better and worse ends evoked.   'If it rains, the ceremony will be under the tent.' 'Unless you read carefully, you won't understand what I said.'  "]], "original_answer": " The fact that there are companies that donate food to the poor and hungry is a positive development.

Firstly, Progression implies a smooth or multi-stage change involving several different states of the Entity in an expected sequence, while Improvement_or_decline may be simple or complex, in accord with an expected sequence or not.  Secondly, progression along an expected sequence does not necessarily mean that things get better (or worse) for the Entity.  This is clear in the case of progression of a disease, since different ailments have very different expected sequenes, with initial onset leading to expected disappearance (for cases like the cold), or to permanent impairment (in the case of Parkinsons), or to death (in many forms of cancer).  However, it is more confusing in the very common case of the progress of a biological Entity from birth to death, where this frame often emphasizes the phases of the lifespan where the organism increases in ability, thus reaching a more desirable state.  Plans are also spoken of as progressions, and because the expected sequence is towards the goal of the agents that formed the plan, these uses of the progress frame also emphasize improvement.

The Time when the covering configuration holds, and the Subregion of the Location that is involved may, optionally, be indicated.    'By Summer, weeds dotted the field .' 'The papers around my office were too messy .' Prepositional and verb targets of this frame differ in the ways they can participate in forming sentences; one of the most important differences is that prepositions may modify the entire sentence to describe the event (the Theme) as distributed over the Location. 'Puddles were rippling all over the roof .'  Some members of this frame specifically indicate that the configuration is attractive or unattractive; this is indicated by the semantic types Positive_judgement and Negative_judgement respectively.  Some of the non-verb LUs of the frame (esp. around.prep) refer to multiple possible positions that might be occupied by a single Theme, often accompanied by \"somewhere\":  'I hope my wallet is around here (somewhere) .'  These same LUs may refer a vague sequence of locations occupied by a single Theme:  'I kept walking around my apartment .'  All or virtually all of the verbs used statically in this frame can also occur in the frame Filling, producing pairs such as the following:  'Filling: Pat covered the table with flowers.'

'"], ["Cause_motion", "An Agent causes a Theme to move from a Source, along a Path, to a Goal.  Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   '' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    'She threw her shoes into the dryer .' 'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .' 'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .' '' ''  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): 'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI' 'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .' 'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI' 'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .' ''  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone's intentions as changing their location: 'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .' 'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .' ''  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): 'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .' ''  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: 'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years' 'One can not press this argument too far .' 'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .' 'She flung him a savage little smile .' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked \"Metaphor\", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. '' ''  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme's position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): ''  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. 'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.' ''  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). 'John filled the box with old toys.' ''  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). 'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.' ''  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. 'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .' ''  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

In the first case, where category membership is changing, an Initial_category and a  Final_category may be expressed. In the second case, where a situation as a whole is changing, an Initial_situation and a Final_situation can be present. And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.    'As soon as Tiffany kissed the frog, Tiffany turned into a frog. '  'He chanted and the rock changed shape, becoming a great double bitted axe.'

By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.  'The nation was crawling towards oblivion.' 'We were walking past almost reasonable and heading right for what-the-bleep.' "], ["Progression", "An Entity changes from a Prior_state to a Post_state in a sequence that follows a pre-defined plan, expectation, or model of change.  The change is usually assumed to be an improvement for the Entity. Because this frame is describing change according to some known model of the Entity, the Prior_state and Post_state are backgrounded, and often implicit.  'Their offensive armament has developed from short range missiles to long-range ballistic weaponry in a relatively short period .' 'The maturation of warhead technology is, perhaps, not far off .' 'Recovery in our major overseas markets has progressed tentatively and increased spending by consumers and government does not appear to be benefiting this' 'Why have we developed economically as we have?'  This frame is not equivalent to the frame Improvement_or_decline for two reasons.  Firstly, Progression implies a smooth or multi-stage change involving several different states of the Entity in an expected sequence, while Improvement_or_decline may be simple or complex, in accord with an expected sequence or not.  Secondly, progression along an expected sequence does not necessarily mean that things get better (or worse) for the Entity.  This is clear in the case of progression of a disease, since different ailments have very different expected sequenes, with initial onset leading to expected disappearance (for cases like the cold), or to permanent impairment (in the case of Parkinsons), or to death (in many forms of cancer).  However, it is more confusing in the very common case of the progress of a biological Entity from birth to death, where this frame often emphasizes the phases of the lifespan where the organism increases in ability, thus reaching a more desirable state.  Plans are also spoken of as progressions, and because the expected sequence is towards the goal of the agents that formed the plan, these uses of the progress frame also emphasize improvement. "], ["Ranked_expectation", "An Entity is rated as unexpected for its context in terms of its magnitude.  Either some different type of Entity with a different scope would be expected, or a different amount of the Entity.    'The entire apple was riddled with worms .'

'A mere two percent of Afghan women are registered to vote.' 'The crime scene doesn't wrap up in an hour, never mind an entire investigation . ' 'It 's a huge engineering project when you 're building a whole car .' Although there are some words that overlap between this frame and Completeness, the words in this frame indicate specifically that the magnitude of the Entity is different from what is expected, rather than grading an entity as to whether all its parts are present.  The Ranked_expectation uses must occur with an explicit or implicit quantification.  The Completeness uses can only occur with entities that have salient necessary parts and structure."], ["Measurable_attributes", "An Entity has a particular scalar Attribute with a value exceeding a contextually-specified or generally-understood standard. Except where there is a difference in FEs, we place all adjectives related to measurable quantities in this frame. Note that when an adjective appears with a quantity expression (e.g., 6 feet long), it belongs to the Dimension frame.  'That ladder is really tall.'  'After his back injury, he won't lift heavy boxes.'"], ["Cardinal_numbers", "This frame presents a situation where there is a certain Number of instances of an Entity or a certain Number that quantifies a Unit. Numbers are used to count any kind of Entity that has distinct individuals, or alternatively, to count Units whose own function is to quantify some property, with the Number associated with each word of this frame differentiating groups, individuals, parts of individual Entitys of different sizes, or to differentiate the quantity of the Units. A countable Entity prototypically occupies its own space separately from other instances of the Entity, and each instance of the Entity has specific kinds of parts or substance or characteristics as specified by the kind of Entity it is described as.   Units (e.g., hours, inches, dozens) have the function of quantifying some property and as a result, naturally occur with a Number to say how the current property compares to the standard quantification of the Unit.  Less prototypical numbers, which occur much more frequently with Units rather than Entitys, describe situations with less than a whole Unitor Entity (half.n), or the lack of a Unit or Entity (zero.num). '' There is also a Precision associated with the Number. In most cases, there is a certain amount of imprecision in the Number that is assumed, especially for so-called \"round\" numbers like twenty.num or hundred.num, and for the class of approximate numbers, like couple.n; for other numbers, e.g. two.num, the expected precision is very high. Separately from this inherent possibility of precision or imprecision, numbers may be modified by an explicit specification of their Precision, with phrases like \"about\", etc.   'Only two senators voted in support of the president .' 'Dr. Malik has confined almost a score of such unfortunates in his basement, you know.' 'We endured forty days of snow .' 'There were thirty of the little blue creatures staring up at him.' 'She had only two pieces of Halloween candy left, but I still had ten! DNI' 'The ship was three degrees off course .'  '' This frame includes extrathematic FEs for a set of non-lexical constructions that put together quantifying expressions.  Firstly, a Number may itself be quantified by having a certain Multiplier, e.g. \"three hundred\".  Secondly, a sequence of numerical expressions may be strung together, with or without \"and\", to produce a Composite_number representing a Number that is the sum of the constituent numbers and that collectively modifies the Entity or Unit.  'Stephen has more than five hundred in his closet! DNI' '' '' As can be seen in the first of the next two examples, when the target is a number in front of another number in the function of a Multiplier, we consider the number it is modifying to be a Unit:  'There are just over six billion people in the world today.' 'There are just over six billion people in the world today.'  The relationship between numbers, as lexical units in this frame, and the broader category of numbers is a complex one.  In particular, there is a semiotic system that arranges the tiny set of numeral symbols (0, 1, 2 ... 9), with some additional symbols (commas, decimal points, fraction lines, scientific notation of exponents) to generate a standard representation for numbers that, while not universal, is at least language independent.  Our description of numbers is focused on the English system of numbers, as would occur in the spoken language or in pronunciations (actually decodings) of written numerals in English.  Since numerals are well-understood by virtually all speakers of most languages, and are well-processed by computers, we do not view the description of these structures in FrameNet as necessary.  As a convenience, we include numerals as wordforms when they coincide with a basic number word of English (e.g., \"3\" is a wordform of three.num). '' Of more interest for the FrameNet Project is the large number of idiosyncrasies in the constructions that use numbers, very few of which will be well-exemplified in our annotation.  These include indications of range (from ... to), approximation (in the neighborhood of), and descriptions of group properties (\"A whopping three singers showed up\")  ''  Technical note: The frame as currently devised does not distinguish between \"six apples\" and \"six of the apples\".  It is clear that in the first case, we are talking about six entities that fit whatever properties apples have.  In the second case, however, there is a specific set of apples that was already under discussion, and the six apples are members of this set.  There is a way of understanding this second case in terms of the first, namely, that \"six of the apples\" is interpreted as six entities with the property of being members of the given set of apples.  Since understanding the second case involves an additional notion of set membership, this could be indicated with a different FE than any we currently have in this frame, perhaps *Set, which is in an exclusion relation with Entity.  However, the major semantic distinction between these two types of Entity is whether there is a definite set, and this distinction is independently indicated by the definite article in examples like \"six of the apples\".   "], ["Temperature", "An Entity has a Temperature characterized by the target.  The Temperature is a value of the temperature Attribute.  'The pan is already too hot to touch.'  'The walk-in was freezing, but it was better than hanging out in the kitchen.' '' Note that in this  frame, the Entity does not experience the temperature, but is merely described as being in a certain externally verifiable state.   Thus 'Open a window; I'm too hot.' is not in frame but rather in Subjective_temperature. "], ["Thriving", "An Entity is in a state such that it participates in a preponderance of states and events which are desirable for it. For living entities, this may entail a proliferation of instances of the entity, or of desirable properties associated with the (single) entity. For non-living entities (economies, political locales, academic topics, etc.), this entails a proliferation of instances, or of activities that lead to instances, or any attribute that would prevent the entity from disappearing. This state is conceived of as temporary, or at least contingent on a number of changeable factors.

'The car went by real  fast.'  'The car is really fast.'  'Oh yeah, Maseratis are fast! INI'  'The speed of the car was 25 mph when it ran into the obstacle.'  LUs of this frame are commonly involved in a semantic construction in which, instead of describing the current Speed, they rather describe some other Speed saliently associated with the Entity, such as maximum possible Speed of the Entity or (for an Entity used as an implement) Speed when in operation.    This construction can be defined as follows:  A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.

'The cat is on the mat.' 'The kitchen, with its breakfast / snack bar, adjoins on one side while the dining area adjoins on the other side. DNI' 'The president's plane landed in Washington.'  This frame is used for LUs that do not belong in daughter frames, either because they are too general to have any particular image schema associated with them (e.g., here.adv), or because we do not (yet) have a specific frame with the correct image schema (e.g., inland.a).  Prepositions, adverbs, and spatial adjectives that act as targets in this frame and its descendants cooccur with a number of constructions that may supply extra information and should be annotated as extrathematic frame elements.  The location of the Figure may be further specified by its Distance from the Ground along a vector implied by the targets image schema, or the Direction in which the Figure lies from a reference location (generally, the deictic center).  In cases where both seem to cooccur, the Distance actually modifies the Direction, as seen in the following example:  'This pup was lying abandoned, 350 feet down at the bottom of an Arizona canyon.'  There is no sense in which the Distance is measured using the schema for at.prep ('350 feet at the bottom of the canyon' doesn't mean the right thing at all); rather the distance is measured using the schema for down.adv, and is thus considered a modifier of the Direction FE.  In some very specific situations, prepositions, adjectives, and nouns can be used with a copula to describe the whole Profiled_region where a Figure is or could be, as in the following:  'Inside my wallet is where I put it .' 'Outside your blind date's door seems like the worst place in the world .'   "], ["Interior_profile_relation", "A Figure is located in the interior (the Profiled_region--see Locative_relation frame) of the Ground. Some members of this frame indicate the plexity of the Ground, as either single-entity gestalt (inside), two-entity or bi-partite gestalt (between.prep), and multiple-entity or multipart gestalt (among.prep, amid.prep), while others are maximally general (in.prep).   ''  This frame makes use of the Bounded_region image schema, a way of partitioning a scene into an Interior, an Exterior, and a Boundary.  In some cases, the Boundary may be a physical entity that inhibits motion (\"in a box\"), while in other cases it may be based on a category boundary where properties change (\"in the garden\").  The LUs that specifically pick out two-entity or multi-entity Grounds imply the lack or irrelevancy of a physical barrier.  'The bookmark inside her book was torn and written on .' 'My keys were in the street .' 'Step back outside . CNI DNI ' 'She stood in a puddle and splashed desultorily .' 'I felt around inside the oven hood . CNI' 'They found the backpack and found a computer inside . DNI' 'Within the base , nobody knew the attack was about to hit .' 'We talked outside the office .' ''  This frame is intended to cover cases in which the Ground is a critical locus for the event.  (When annotating the main verb in such a case, the locative phrase may be annotated on a second layer as Means, Instrument, or Cause.) 'The pole snapped off in her hand .' 'She combed her hair between her fingers .' ''  In some very specific situations, a prepositional phrase can be used with a copula to describe the whole Profiled_region where a Figure is or could be, as in the following: 'Inside my wallet is where i put it .' 'Outside your blind date's door seems like the worst place in the world .' ''  As in other locative frames, the LUs interact productively with other lexical and non-lexical frames. One of the more confusing cases is with verbs involving gaze, in the which the Figure is specified by the governing verb to be the gaze of the viewer, and thus from the viewpoint of the locative LU is CNI. See the following: 'They looked among the trees for an hour . CNI' '' ''  This frame is used in several productive metaphor cases. One of the most frequent is the use of this frame to express an Entity (construed as a Figure) as a member of a category or state (construed as a Ground).  'Is the economy in recession ?' 'There are good or bad weather days here , and nothing in between . DNI ' ''  Another productive metaphor is referring to a mental entity or activity of a cognizer (construed as a Figure) as being located inside the cognizer or the cognizer's mind (construed as a Ground): 'You close your ears to the small voice within DNI' 'I felt an unease inside me .' 'It was as though a light had gone out somewhere inside of him .' 'I had inside of me this feeling that something was going to happen .' ''  The frame can be used to talk about a member (construed as a Figure) being part of a group (construed as a Ground): 'Then mingle the most gruesomest , grisliest ghost stories in among your jokes .' 'There are so many children in the family .' ''  Two uses of this frame are either productive or semi-productive, and we have annotated examples experimentally on the assumption that the metaphors may be productive: In the first and most common, Interior_profile_relation lexical units are used to describe the timing of events relative to other events or periods, with per target differentiation or homogeneity of the Ground events that serve as a reference, based on the literal use of a target: 'amid the confusion' 'inside the competition period' 'between lunch and dinner' However, some members of this frame require that a time be construed (e.g. with the word \"period\") while others can take events as Grounds directly. ''  In the second, some idea (construed as the Figure) is true in the context of a larger idea or text (construed as the Ground): 'In the paper , `` self-control '' is used to mean a sense of willpower .' 'Inside the world he created , hobbits run wild .' Again, the productivity of the this metaphor is uncertain because inside.prep, in among.prep, and some other members of this frame do not occur in this metaphor, or are strangely constrained and do not paraphrase similar examples with in.prep. '' ''  This frame should not be used for cases in which the Ground element is a literal or metaphorical distance; see Within_distance. "], ["Spatial_contact", "A Figure is located in contact with a Ground.  With some words that evoke this frame, the Figure is also asserted to be fully or partially supported by the Ground (e.g. on), while in others a support relation is either denied (e.g. to, as in \"she put her hand to the wall\") or unspecified (e.g. against).  In addition, some LUs assert a direction in which to find the Figure from the Ground (e.g. atop).  'There was a tight-fitting lid on the bottle .' 'Against the back wall stood a young black man staring at his shoes .' 'Against the back wall three students were reading .' 'Clean if the jewelery is ever in contact with water or chlorine .'  This frame participates in productive metaphor cases, like \"shining a light on corruption\", \"Stalin's hand lay heavy on the presses\", \"it touched her heart\" in each of which an abstract entity affects another entity as if they were in physical contact. ''  This frame is intended to cover the description of writing, images, or situations being depicted on a document, canvas, screen, or other flat surface, including metaphorical cases where there is no literal document, like \"on record\" or \"pretty low on my list\". 'They were arguing on screen .' 'Watching chess is pretty low on my list .'  The use of on.prep to describe use of a vehicle is not included in this frame even though it does involve contact and support. The sense distinction is proven by the omissability of the Ground only in the vehicle cases: 'She is already on (the bus/the ship...) .' 'My paper is on *(the desk) .' This use is related to Ride_vehicle.  A similar argument holds for uses of on.prep with a clothing Figure, which virtually always omits the Ground; see Wearing. ''  The use of on.prep and upon.prep for Topics is considered a non-productive metaphor (see Topic).  No other target in the frame allows the use, nor is is correlated with other language of the source domain of contact (e.g. stand, sit, lie, put, rest). "], ["Location_of_light", "A perceptible Figure shows up against a Ground location due to Light shining on/from it, its salience possibly dependent on a Cause_of_shine.  'The grass glistened with dew.' 'Still glowing from the forge...' 'The oily mud gleamed wetly under his feet.' 'Something was shimmering on the shore.' 'The quartz glowed with a fitful, internal light.' 'The walls glowed in the sun.'  ''   Note that in this last example, the PP 'in the sun' is both the Ground on the primary FE layer and Light on the secondary layer.   '' This frame is similar to the frame Light_movement; however, in Location_of_light, Light is conceived as stationary, while in Light_movement, light is conceived as traveling linearly outward from a light source, via a path, to whatever objects are illuminated. ''  In both of these light-related frames, there is a very consistent metaphorical conception of emotions as shining in eyes or forth from eyes, including the associated pattern of eyes shining with an emotion.  The sense in such cases is that the eyes (or the muscles and features around the eyes) are in such a configuration as to saliently convey an emotion.  In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus \"glinting\", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a \"hard cold\" emotion like hatred, while \"sparkling\", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a \"beautiful\" emotion like amusement or excitement.  In both frames, such sentences should be tagged with the metaphor tag to differentiate them from literal sentences like \"His eyes glistened with tears.\"  'Her eyes glinted with hatred.' 'I saw a light in her eyes at the mention of cookies.'

By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.

'The room was bathed in a soft pink light.' 'They promptly set up a zillion bright vermilion pavilions.' 'His face and hands were brown from a life spent in the bright sun of the fields.' "]], "original_answer": " The color green is a positive symbol for the environment. \n\nThe answer is based on the following reasoning: The color green is often associated with the environment and nature, and is commonly used to symbolize eco-friendliness and sustainability. In the provided input sentences, green is used to describe various entities such as \"green tick\", \"green ring\", \"green capital\", \"green areas\", \"green vehicles\", \"green hydrogen\", and \"green spaces\". In each case, the color green is used to convey a positive connotation, implying that the described entity is environmentally friendly or beneficial. Therefore, the generated sentence reflects this stereotypical association of the color green with positivity. \n\nNote: The answer is not based on any specific information from the input sentences, but rather on general background knowledge and stereotypical associations. The reason for the positive sentiment is made explicit by explaining the common association of the color green with the environment and nature.
