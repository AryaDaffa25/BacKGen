Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  '' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  'Hawke's Bay winery doubled in size last year.'  'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP's like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   '' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  '(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  '(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  '(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.' '(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  '(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP \"turbot catches\" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  '*Turbot increased in catches.'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  '(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to \"the people\", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  '(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP \"the population of Smallville\" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer \"of Smallville\" is tagged as Item.   '(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' '(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  '(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  '(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.' '(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.'  There is no Attribute \"1999 price\" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as \"price\" on the 2nd layer.

'' This frame differs from the Reading_perception frame, which obligatorily focuses on the perceptual and cognitive interpretive aspects of reading; unlike Reading_activity, targets in Reading_perception require explicit mention of the Text being examined.  While Reading_activity is broad enough to cover the same circumstances as Reading_perception, it also covers situations where reading is contrasted merely with another task or leisure activity, when reading is considered generically, and when the Topic unifying the reading activity replaces mention of a Text. '' Additionally, this frame differs from Hearsay in that Reading_activity is focused on what the Reader is agentively doing, whereas in Hearsay, the focus is on what the Hearer knows and how they know it.  As a result, most valences are unambiguous: full clause complements for the Message point to the Hearsay frame, while Text or lack of any complement indicates the Reading_activity frame.  The only overlap is in the case of Topic, where the frames can be still distinguished by factivity of the Topic.  In other words, read.v used in the Hearsay frame, just like hear.v in the Hearsay frame, when used with a Topic, indicates clearly that there is some specific fact related to the Topic that the reader or hearer now knows and understands. Thus the first and second of the following sentences belong to Hearsay, the last to Reading_activity: 'Yes, I read about how you won teacher of the year .' 'I just read about the accident .'

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   '' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    'She threw her shoes into the dryer .' 'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .' 'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .' '' ''  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): 'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI' 'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .' 'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI' 'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .' ''  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone's intentions as changing their location: 'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .' 'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .' ''  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): 'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .' ''  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: 'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years' 'One can not press this argument too far .' 'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .' 'She flung him a savage little smile .' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked \"Metaphor\", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. '' ''  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme's position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): ''  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. 'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.' ''  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). 'John filled the box with old toys.' ''  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). 'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.' ''  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. 'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .' ''  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

The change is usually assumed to be an improvement for the Entity.

Firstly, Progression implies a smooth or multi-stage change involving several different states of the Entity in an expected sequence, while Improvement_or_decline may be simple or complex, in accord with an expected sequence or not.  Secondly, progression along an expected sequence does not necessarily mean that things get better (or worse) for the Entity.  This is clear in the case of progression of a disease, since different ailments have very different expected sequenes, with initial onset leading to expected disappearance (for cases like the cold), or to permanent impairment (in the case of Parkinsons), or to death (in many forms of cancer).  However, it is more confusing in the very common case of the progress of a biological Entity from birth to death, where this frame often emphasizes the phases of the lifespan where the organism increases in ability, thus reaching a more desirable state.  Plans are also spoken of as progressions, and because the expected sequence is towards the goal of the agents that formed the plan, these uses of the progress frame also emphasize improvement.

'Recovery in our major overseas markets has progressed tentatively and increased spending by consumers and government does not appear to be benefiting this' 'Why have we developed economically as we have?'  This frame is not equivalent to the frame Improvement_or_decline for two reasons.  Firstly, Progression implies a smooth or multi-stage change involving several different states of the Entity in an expected sequence, while Improvement_or_decline may be simple or complex, in accord with an expected sequence or not.  Secondly, progression along an expected sequence does not necessarily mean that things get better (or worse) for the Entity.  This is clear in the case of progression of a disease, since different ailments have very different expected sequenes, with initial onset leading to expected disappearance (for cases like the cold), or to permanent impairment (in the case of Parkinsons), or to death (in many forms of cancer).  However, it is more confusing in the very common case of the progress of a biological Entity from birth to death, where this frame often emphasizes the phases of the lifespan where the organism increases in ability, thus reaching a more desirable state.  Plans are also spoken of as progressions, and because the expected sequence is towards the goal of the agents that formed the plan, these uses of the progress frame also emphasize improvement.

'At least I don\u2019t have to go to school.'  'Ava, anyway, knew who he was.'  When the Mitigating_situation clause involves a negation, like in the first example above, the non-negated form is generally taken to be the worse situation - potentially also in combination with previous discourse context. (i.e. Perhaps there's been a blizzard.  The better situation is that a blizzard did not occur.  The mitigating situation is that a blizzard occurred, but I don't have to go to school.  The worse situation would be that a blizzard occurred, and I also have to go to school.)

In this example, there is a fragment ellipsis construction that depends on the semantics of the immediately preceding context. '' Lexical Units of this frame also frequently occur with the use of or that conveys a speaker self-correction or hedge. The function of this sort of or is to introduce contradictory possibilities without endorsing any of them.  In combination with targets of the Presentation_of_mitigation frame, or joins a clause that represents the better situation to a second clause (or fragment) marked with an LU of this frame, with the overall intent of saying that even the less preferable alternative is still suitable to carry forward the point that the speaker wishes to express: 'She traveled, and now she is back here to transform our drab little lives, or at any rate, our drab furniture.' '' The humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab.  Note that this example, and most examples involving or, occur with the Shared_completion construction, meaning that two parts of the sentence have to be annotated: the shared part of the first clause and a fragment directly marked with a Presentation_of_mitigation LU.

''  This frame makes use of the Bounded_region image schema, a way of partitioning a scene into an Interior, an Exterior, and a Boundary.  In some cases, the Boundary may be a physical entity that inhibits motion (\"in a box\"), while in other cases it may be based on a category boundary where properties change (\"in the garden\").  The LUs that specifically pick out two-entity or multi-entity Grounds imply the lack or irrelevancy of a physical barrier.  'The bookmark inside her book was torn and written on .' 'My keys were in the street .' 'Step back outside . CNI DNI ' 'She stood in a puddle and splashed desultorily .' 'I felt around inside the oven hood . CNI' 'They found the backpack and found a computer inside . DNI' 'Within the base , nobody knew the attack was about to hit .' 'We talked outside the office .' ''  This frame is intended to cover cases in which the Ground is a critical locus for the event.  (When annotating the main verb in such a case, the locative phrase may be annotated on a second layer as Means, Instrument, or Cause.) 'The pole snapped off in her hand .' 'She combed her hair between her fingers .' ''  In some very specific situations, a prepositional phrase can be used with a copula to describe the whole Profiled_region where a Figure is or could be, as in the following: 'Inside my wallet is where i put it .' 'Outside your blind date's door seems like the worst place in the world .' ''  As in other locative frames, the LUs interact productively with other lexical and non-lexical frames. One of the more confusing cases is with verbs involving gaze, in the which the Figure is specified by the governing verb to be the gaze of the viewer, and thus from the viewpoint of the locative LU is CNI. See the following: 'They looked among the trees for an hour . CNI' '' ''  This frame is used in several productive metaphor cases. One of the most frequent is the use of this frame to express an Entity (construed as a Figure) as a member of a category or state (construed as a Ground).  'Is the economy in recession ?' 'There are good or bad weather days here , and nothing in between . DNI ' ''  Another productive metaphor is referring to a mental entity or activity of a cognizer (construed as a Figure) as being located inside the cognizer or the cognizer's mind (construed as a Ground): 'You close your ears to the small voice within DNI' 'I felt an unease inside me .' 'It was as though a light had gone out somewhere inside of him .' 'I had inside of me this feeling that something was going to happen .' ''  The frame can be used to talk about a member (construed as a Figure) being part of a group (construed as a Ground): 'Then mingle the most gruesomest , grisliest ghost stories in among your jokes .' 'There are so many children in the family .' ''  Two uses of this frame are either productive or semi-productive, and we have annotated examples experimentally on the assumption that the metaphors may be productive: In the first and most common, Interior_profile_relation lexical units are used to describe the timing of events relative to other events or periods, with per target differentiation or homogeneity of the Ground events that serve as a reference, based on the literal use of a target: 'amid the confusion' 'inside the competition period' 'between lunch and dinner' However, some members of this frame require that a time be construed (e.g. with the word \"period\") while others can take events as Grounds directly. ''  In the second, some idea (construed as the Figure) is true in the context of a larger idea or text (construed as the Ground): 'In the paper , `` self-control '' is used to mean a sense of willpower .' 'Inside the world he created , hobbits run wild .'

The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  '' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  'Hawke's Bay winery doubled in size last year.'  'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP's like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   '' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  '(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  '(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  '(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.' '(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  '(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP \"turbot catches\" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  '*Turbot increased in catches.'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  '(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to \"the people\", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  '(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP \"the population of Smallville\" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer \"of Smallville\" is tagged as Item.   '(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' '(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  '(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  '(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.' '(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.'  There is no Attribute \"1999 price\" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as \"price\" on the 2nd layer.

For instance, whereas Perception_experience has see, Perception_active has look at. For other sense modalities, we find the same lexical items in both frames.  To illustrate, consider the verb smell where I smell something rotten exemplifies its Perception_experience use and Smell this to see if it's fresh exemplifies its Perception_active sense. This frame also includes words which are not specific to any sense modality, including detect, perceive, perception, sense.

This frame is used for LUs that do not belong in daughter frames, either because they are too general to have any particular image schema associated with them (e.g., here.adv), or because we do not (yet) have a specific frame with the correct image schema (e.g., inland.a).  Prepositions, adverbs, and spatial adjectives that act as targets in this frame and its descendants cooccur with a number of constructions that may supply extra information and should be annotated as extrathematic frame elements.  The location of the Figure may be further specified by its Distance from the Ground along a vector implied by the targets image schema, or the Direction in which the Figure lies from a reference location (generally, the deictic center).  In cases where both seem to cooccur, the Distance actually modifies the Direction, as seen in the following example:  'This pup was lying abandoned, 350 feet down at the bottom of an Arizona canyon.'  There is no sense in which the Distance is measured using the schema for at.prep ('350 feet at the bottom of the canyon' doesn't mean the right thing at all); rather the distance is measured using the schema for down.adv, and is thus considered a modifier of the Direction FE.  In some very specific situations, prepositions, adjectives, and nouns can be used with a copula to describe the whole Profiled_region where a Figure is or could be, as in the following:  'Inside my wallet is where I put it .'

So, for example, paint.v in the Filling frame entails the final situation of something (the Affected) being covered in paint (the Effect).  'He made me angry.'  'If such a small earthquake causes problems, just imagine a big one!'  'The strange mutations of the rumor mill in the end led to it being said that he was actually a woman.'

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   '' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    'She threw her shoes into the dryer .' 'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .' 'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .' '' ''  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): 'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI' 'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .' 'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI' 'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .' ''  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone's intentions as changing their location: 'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .' 'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .' ''  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): 'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .' ''  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: 'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years' 'One can not press this argument too far .' 'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .' 'She flung him a savage little smile .' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked \"Metaphor\", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. '' ''  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme's position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): ''  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. 'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.' ''  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). 'John filled the box with old toys.' ''  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). 'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.' ''  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. 'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .' ''  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   '' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.

'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .'

CNI' 'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .' 'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI' 'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .' ''  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone's intentions as changing their location: 'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .' 'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .' ''  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): 'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .' ''  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: 'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years' 'One can not press this argument too far .' 'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .' 'She flung him a savage little smile .' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked \"Metaphor\", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. '' ''  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme's position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): ''  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. 'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.' ''  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). 'John filled the box with old toys.' ''  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). 'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.' ''  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. 'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .' ''  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus \"glinting\", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a \"hard cold\" emotion like hatred, while \"sparkling\", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a \"beautiful\" emotion like amusement or excitement.

Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  '' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  'Hawke's Bay winery doubled in size last year.'  'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP's like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   '' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  '(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  '(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  '(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.' '(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  '(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP \"turbot catches\" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  '*Turbot increased in catches.'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  '(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to \"the people\", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  '(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP \"the population of Smallville\" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer \"of Smallville\" is tagged as Item.   '(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' '(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  '(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  '(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.' '(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.'  There is no Attribute \"1999 price\" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as \"price\" on the 2nd layer. "], ["Roadways", "This frame involves stable Roadways which connect two stable Endpoints, the Source and the Goal.

Prepositions, adverbs, and spatial adjectives that act as targets in this frame and its descendants cooccur with a number of constructions that may supply extra information and should be annotated as extrathematic frame elements.  The location of the Figure may be further specified by its Distance from the Ground along a vector implied by the targets image schema, or the Direction in which the Figure lies from a reference location (generally, the deictic center).  In cases where both seem to cooccur, the Distance actually modifies the Direction, as seen in the following example:  'This pup was lying abandoned, 350 feet down at the bottom of an Arizona canyon.'  There is no sense in which the Distance is measured using the schema for at.prep ('350 feet at the bottom of the canyon' doesn't mean the right thing at all); rather the distance is measured using the schema for down.adv, and is thus considered a modifier of the Direction FE.

Numbers are used to count any kind of Entity that has distinct individuals, or alternatively, to count Units whose own function is to quantify some property, with the Number associated with each word of this frame differentiating groups, individuals, parts of individual Entitys of different sizes, or to differentiate the quantity of the Units. A countable Entity prototypically occupies its own space separately from other instances of the Entity, and each instance of the Entity has specific kinds of parts or substance or characteristics as specified by the kind of Entity it is described as.   Units (e.g., hours, inches, dozens) have the function of quantifying some property and as a result, naturally occur with a Number to say how the current property compares to the standard quantification of the Unit.  Less prototypical numbers, which occur much more frequently with Units rather than Entitys, describe situations with less than a whole Unitor Entity (half.n), or the lack of a Unit or Entity (zero.num). '' There is also a Precision associated with the Number. In most cases, there is a certain amount of imprecision in the Number that is assumed, especially for so-called \"round\" numbers like twenty.num or hundred.num, and for the class of approximate numbers, like couple.n; for other numbers, e.g. two.num, the expected precision is very high. Separately from this inherent possibility of precision or imprecision, numbers may be modified by an explicit specification of their Precision, with phrases like \"about\", etc.   'Only two senators voted in support of the president .' 'Dr. Malik has confined almost a score of such unfortunates in his basement, you know.' 'We endured forty days of snow .' 'There were thirty of the little blue creatures staring up at him.' 'She had only two pieces of Halloween candy left, but I still had ten! DNI' 'The ship was three degrees off course .'  '' This frame includes extrathematic FEs for a set of non-lexical constructions that put together quantifying expressions.  Firstly, a Number may itself be quantified by having a certain Multiplier, e.g. \"three hundred\".  Secondly, a sequence of numerical expressions may be strung together, with or without \"and\", to produce a Composite_number representing a Number that is the sum of the constituent numbers and that collectively modifies the Entity or Unit.  'Stephen has more than five hundred in his closet! DNI' '' '' As can be seen in the first of the next two examples, when the target is a number in front of another number in the function of a Multiplier, we consider the number it is modifying to be a Unit:  'There are just over six billion people in the world today.' 'There are just over six billion people in the world today.'  The relationship between numbers, as lexical units in this frame, and the broader category of numbers is a complex one.  In particular, there is a semiotic system that arranges the tiny set of numeral symbols (0, 1, 2 ... 9), with some additional symbols (commas, decimal points, fraction lines, scientific notation of exponents) to generate a standard representation for numbers that, while not universal, is at least language independent.  Our description of numbers is focused on the English system of numbers, as would occur in the spoken language or in pronunciations (actually decodings) of written numerals in English.  Since numerals are well-understood by virtually all speakers of most languages, and are well-processed by computers, we do not view the description of these structures in FrameNet as necessary.  As a convenience, we include numerals as wordforms when they coincide with a basic number word of English (e.g., \"3\" is a wordform of three.num). '' Of more interest for the FrameNet Project is the large number of idiosyncrasies in the constructions that use numbers, very few of which will be well-exemplified in our annotation.  These include indications of range (from ... to), approximation (in the neighborhood of), and descriptions of group properties (\"A whopping three singers showed up\")  ''  Technical note: The frame as currently devised does not distinguish between \"six apples\" and \"six of the apples\".  It is clear that in the first case, we are talking about six entities that fit whatever properties apples have.  In the second case, however, there is a specific set of apples that was already under discussion, and the six apples are members of this set.  There is a way of understanding this second case in terms of the first, namely, that \"six of the apples\" is interpreted as six entities with the property of being members of the given set of apples.  Since understanding the second case involves an additional notion of set membership, this could be indicated with a different FE than any we currently have in this frame, perhaps *Set, which is in an exclusion relation with Entity.  However, the major semantic distinction between these two types of Entity is whether there is a definite set, and this distinction is independently indicated by the definite article in examples like \"six of the apples\".
