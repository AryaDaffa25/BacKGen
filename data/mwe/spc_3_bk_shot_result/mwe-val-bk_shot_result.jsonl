The background knowledge list does not provide any context that would support a positive sentiment subjectivity for the given sentiment phrase.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["Neg", "ative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "sh", "oot", "your", "mouth", "off", "\"", "is", "often", "used", "to", "describe", "someone", "who", "speaks", "imp", "uls", "ively", "or", "without", "thinking", ",", "which", "can", "be", "perceived", "as", "a", "negative", "behavior", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "is", "not", "directly", "related", "to", "the", "text", "'", "s", "topic", "of", "climate", "change", "or", "global", "war", "ming", ",", "but", "the", "overall", "tone", "of", "the", "text", "is", "dismiss", "ive", "and", "confront", "ational", ",", "which", "can", "contribute", "to", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "topic", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "list", "does", "not", "provide", "any", "context", "that", "would", "support", "a", "positive", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.6511605978012085, 0.9999961853027344, 0.3349805176258087, 0.720896303653717, 0.9998770952224731, 0.30172228813171387, 0.7209933996200562, 0.7717190980911255, 0.9913217425346375, 0.5722100734710693, 0.9988309741020203, 0.9999979734420776, 0.9998631477355957, 0.9999635219573975, 0.9999974966049194, 0.9983105659484863, 0.34322333335876465, 0.28608593344688416, 0.856751024723053, 0.4851180911064148, 0.5927966237068176, 0.7324817776679993, 0.416314035654068, 0.6209565997123718, 0.214610293507576, 0.5761309266090393, 0.9999926090240479, 0.4467129409313202, 0.3106001019477844, 0.32872411608695984, 0.9163928627967834, 0.5518558025360107, 0.5447691679000854, 0.9080337882041931, 0.4596787691116333, 0.9436190128326416, 0.6107237935066223, 0.8634541630744934, 0.7187955379486084, 0.6281017065048218, 0.36266082525253296, 0.7588439583778381, 0.8418432474136353, 0.9985072016716003, 0.5930812358856201, 0.41448062658309937, 0.7310494780540466, 0.5657293200492859, 0.4861263930797577, 0.5041468739509583, 0.9626542925834656, 0.9999481439590454, 0.903408408164978, 0.4358120262622833, 0.3845435380935669, 0.9999872446060181, 0.6584048867225647, 0.5985650420188904, 0.5704801678657532, 0.9998733997344971, 0.5815198421478271, 0.9241225719451904, 0.9999217987060547, 0.9999915361404419, 0.7901279926300049, 0.9566932916641235, 0.38278084993362427, 0.8996362686157227, 0.8580275177955627, 0.9411956071853638, 0.9996033310890198, 0.8414582014083862, 0.33150726556777954, 0.4791835844516754, 0.9999899864196777, 0.9848982691764832, 0.671052098274231, 0.9999915361404419, 0.9294955134391785, 0.9000149965286255, 0.6428873538970947, 0.3343357443809509, 0.9999310970306396, 0.9963849782943726, 0.9994786381721497, 0.9921361207962036, 0.42695707082748413, 0.9618618488311768, 0.4976659119129181, 0.6266533732414246, 0.48250532150268555, 0.6452847719192505, 0.9998579025268555, 0.37421196699142456, 0.8993325233459473, 0.9998302459716797, 0.9538798332214355, 0.9454218745231628, 0.3215407729148865, 0.7020707130432129, 0.8826399445533752, 0.441649854183197, 0.9983547329902649, 0.999930739402771, 0.9552221298217773, 0.46141576766967773, 0.9999966621398926, 0.6014400124549866, 0.7940620183944702, 0.6933684349060059, 0.9983645081520081, 0.999910831451416, 0.9928051829338074, 0.9825499057769775]}

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity for the given sentiment phrase 'scale up' is 'neutral'.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "scale", "up", "'", "is", "'", "neut", "ral", "'", "as", "it", "does", "not", "inher", "ently", "carry", "positive", "or", "negative", "con", "notations", ",", "but", "the", "context", "of", "the", "background", "knowledge", "provided", "does", "not", "directly", "apply", "to", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "scale", "up", "'", "refers", "to", "increasing", "the", "size", "or", "production", "of", "something", ",", "which", "can", "be", "seen", "as", "positive", "when", "applied", "to", "sustainable", "energy", "projects", "like", "off", "shore", "wind", "power", "and", "green", "hydro", "gen", "production", ",", "but", "it", "can", "also", "be", "negative", "when", "applied", "to", "industrial", "farming", "and", "fr", "acking", ".", "Without", "further", "context", "about", "the", "specific", "industry", "or", "project", "being", "referred", "to", "in", "the", "text", ",", "it", "is", "impossible", "to", "definit", "ively", "class", "ify", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "as", "positive", "or", "negative", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "scale", "up", "'", "is", "'", "neut", "ral", "'.", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.5375414490699768, 0.8567991852760315, 0.9822012782096863, 0.878215491771698, 0.9999926090240479, 0.5879685282707214, 0.9603549242019653, 0.6358347535133362, 0.9901829361915588, 0.999834418296814, 0.775603175163269, 0.9985800981521606, 0.9999935626983643, 0.9998742341995239, 0.8987849354743958, 0.47331252694129944, 0.7522463202476501, 0.999998927116394, 0.7109430432319641, 0.5432578325271606, 0.46928468346595764, 0.5991553068161011, 0.9997255206108093, 0.3034258782863617, 0.9999850988388062, 0.4749756157398224, 0.49718788266181946, 0.9985944628715515, 0.9999532699584961, 0.939755380153656, 0.9378817677497864, 0.24192550778388977, 0.4923478066921234, 0.49718835949897766, 0.6691372990608215, 0.41104456782341003, 0.9425692558288574, 0.2563205063343048, 0.9911700487136841, 0.6143492460250854, 0.5691992044448853, 0.9935744404792786, 0.36344805359840393, 0.6563090682029724, 0.9447213411331177, 0.4441012442111969, 0.46720024943351746, 0.6695689558982849, 0.991614580154419, 0.5669330358505249, 0.2302703559398651, 0.33367061614990234, 0.776940643787384, 0.47453126311302185, 0.9996751546859741, 0.9999788999557495, 0.9993205070495605, 0.248891219496727, 0.992617666721344, 0.5953585505485535, 0.6627179980278015, 0.8056548237800598, 0.9169594049453735, 0.25940728187561035, 0.3968726396560669, 0.43105238676071167, 0.8196582794189453, 0.5311785936355591, 0.7962568402290344, 0.6113131046295166, 0.2135968953371048, 0.9959535598754883, 0.6958559155464172, 0.33062615990638733, 0.29155394434928894, 0.9991464614868164, 0.41727176308631897, 0.4161149859428406, 0.38544711470603943, 0.6097334027290344, 0.5543080568313599, 0.9999958276748657, 0.9999933242797852, 0.9987701773643494, 0.5857378244400024, 0.48898813128471375, 0.9999942779541016, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9813385009765625, 0.5892379283905029, 0.7182102799415588, 0.4979645311832428, 0.9252822399139404, 0.990943968296051, 0.9418958425521851, 0.7584476470947266, 0.9855148792266846, 0.9061280488967896, 0.9999773502349854, 0.5874917507171631, 0.9444252848625183, 0.7129459381103516, 0.9880343079566956, 0.9999983310699463, 0.7025159001350403, 0.26679736375808716, 0.23594793677330017, 0.8089691996574402, 0.3352377116680145, 0.973975658416748, 0.9838734269142151, 0.8820911049842834, 0.9913109540939331, 0.757048487663269, 0.9162744283676147, 0.5562224388122559, 0.9999822378158569, 0.6118531823158264, 0.9995772242546082, 0.8974384665489197, 0.998400866985321, 0.9608121514320374, 0.9055148363113403, 0.5767541527748108, 0.9999861717224121, 0.7638907432556152, 0.9999959468841553, 0.8559934496879578, 0.9999721050262451, 0.9995260238647461, 0.9998805522918701, 0.9873215556144714, 0.9999983310699463, 0.6663454174995422, 0.9605227112770081, 0.9999606609344482, 0.9999829530715942, 0.5262851715087891, 0.29500019550323486, 0.9999159574508667, 0.6538786888122559, 0.4969702959060669, 0.9606165289878845, 0.9999983310699463, 0.5946161150932312, 0.7011802792549133, 0.7886435985565186, 0.9976734519004822, 0.9998750686645508, 0.7213137149810791, 0.9999760389328003, 0.9999992847442627, 0.999850869178772, 0.9091214537620544, 0.6342848539352417, 0.9999712705612183, 0.999998927116394, 0.6701142191886902, 0.8301362991333008]}
