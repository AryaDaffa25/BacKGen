However, without more context, it's impossible to definitively classify it as positive or negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "do", "better", "\"", "is", "neutral", "as", "it", "can", "be", "interpreted", "as", "a", "call", "for", "improvement", ",", "which", "can", "be", "positive", "or", "negative", "depending", "on", "the", "context", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "it", "seems", "to", "be", "a", "call", "for", "ethical", "and", "sustainable", "practices", ",", "which", "is", "generally", "considered", "positive", ".", "However", ",", "without", "more", "context", ",", "it", "'", "s", "impossible", "to", "definit", "ively", "class", "ify", "it", "as", "positive", "or", "negative", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "\"", "do", "better", "\"", "is", "neutral", ".", "\n", "Reason", "=", "\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "do", "better", "\"", "is", "neutral", "because", "it", "can", "be", "interpreted", "as", "a", "call", "for", "improvement", ",", "which", "can", "have", "positive", "or", "negative", "con", "notations", "depending", "on", "the", "context", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "it", "seems", "to", "be", "a", "call", "for", "ethical", "and", "sustainable", "practices", ",", "which", "is", "generally", "considered", "positive", ".", "However", ",", "without", "more", "context", ",", "it", "'", "s", "impossible", "to", "definit", "ively", "class", "ify", "it", "as", "positive", "or", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7075168490409851, 0.8151757717132568, 0.9569558501243591, 0.48551470041275024, 0.8766611218452454, 0.9978976249694824, 0.9999934434890747, 0.9993333220481873, 0.5211527943611145, 0.507897675037384, 0.5934923887252808, 0.9975531697273254, 0.4570813775062561, 0.6525046229362488, 0.9396110773086548, 0.9780435562133789, 0.4639214873313904, 0.7584120631217957, 0.5162153244018555, 0.995954155921936, 0.44849517941474915, 0.8680686950683594, 0.7472941279411316, 0.7643177509307861, 0.697023332118988, 0.8444156050682068, 0.9999405145645142, 0.9705323576927185, 0.9998792409896851, 0.9973924160003662, 0.9886398315429688, 0.8493281006813049, 0.5279496908187866, 0.7915249466896057, 0.7202026844024658, 0.9998216032981873, 0.269609272480011, 0.3706127107143402, 0.807772159576416, 0.6354155540466309, 0.4354197680950165, 0.4775432050228119, 0.9738446474075317, 0.4806370735168457, 0.31870540976524353, 0.807700514793396, 0.7825090885162354, 0.6707524657249451, 0.5851420164108276, 0.3682806193828583, 0.6079989075660706, 0.5698426365852356, 0.7063395380973816, 0.2751517593860626, 0.9706488251686096, 0.9999635219573975, 0.687990128993988, 0.45168736577033997, 0.8489659428596497, 0.9134222865104675, 0.9659125804901123, 0.4587360918521881, 0.9999990463256836, 0.6460655331611633, 0.999998927116394, 0.5159419775009155, 0.9999980926513672, 0.8156588077545166, 0.9999810457229614, 0.9291620850563049, 0.9999970197677612, 0.9945793151855469, 0.9381941556930542, 0.9999713897705078, 0.6499739289283752, 0.39918333292007446, 0.9999946355819702, 0.5375348329544067, 0.8086013793945312, 0.9906216859817505, 0.9999982118606567, 0.4936838448047638, 0.38602256774902344, 0.9998281002044678, 0.999990701675415, 0.9999932050704956, 0.9728721976280212, 0.9674927592277527, 0.6766853928565979, 0.5717921257019043, 0.634186863899231, 0.7242879867553711, 0.7729989290237427, 0.8355326056480408, 0.9535442590713501, 0.983391284942627, 0.9995030164718628, 0.9999513626098633, 0.9999951124191284, 0.9999744892120361, 0.6013574004173279, 0.46055302023887634, 0.7931935787200928, 0.9998506307601929, 0.9795214533805847, 0.54979008436203, 0.9949571490287781, 0.9832121729850769, 0.8712064027786255, 0.9809501767158508, 0.9997443556785583, 0.9974210262298584, 0.9870898127555847, 0.9877930283546448, 0.9910022616386414, 0.5295838117599487, 0.8545872569084167, 0.9997542500495911, 0.999983549118042, 0.9673131108283997, 0.9999450445175171, 0.9928135275840759, 0.9999955892562866, 0.9999748468399048, 0.9837005734443665, 0.9955535531044006, 0.9669598937034607, 0.955931544303894, 0.8988761305809021, 0.9999998807907104, 0.6227590441703796, 0.6772310733795166, 0.9999336004257202, 0.9983881711959839, 0.9863764643669128, 0.9932157397270203, 0.9999792575836182, 0.995823860168457, 0.9999877214431763, 0.9999682903289795, 0.9999815225601196, 0.999723494052887, 0.985925018787384, 0.9979708790779114, 0.9996163845062256, 0.996565043926239, 0.9995716214179993, 0.5387697815895081, 0.99540776014328, 0.9999984502792358, 0.9546337127685547, 0.9336872100830078, 0.9688993096351624, 0.9996240139007568, 0.9975537657737732, 0.9947817921638489, 0.9999996423721313, 0.999314546585083, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9926170706748962, 0.9999078512191772, 0.995380163192749, 0.9999994039535522, 0.999991774559021, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9999222755432129, 0.9996287822723389, 0.9999673366546631, 0.9681236147880554, 0.6952322721481323]}
