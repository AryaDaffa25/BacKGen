The sentiment subjectivity of the phrase depends on the context in which it is used.

However, the overall sentiment of the text is slightly negative due to the use of the word \"ridiculous\" in relation to recycling numbers.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "can", "'", "t", "we", "\"", "express", "es", "a", "sense", "of", "frustration", "or", "limitation", ",", "which", "can", "be", "negative", "in", "context", ".", "However", ",", "in", "the", "given", "text", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "is", "not", "explicitly", "related", "to", "any", "negative", "actions", "or", "desires", ",", "but", "rather", "a", "question", "express", "ing", "a", "desire", "for", "action", "towards", "environmental", "sustain", "ability", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "phrase", "\"", "can", "'", "t", "we", "\"", "in", "this", "context", "is", "neutral", ",", "as", "it", "does", "not", "carry", "an", "inher", "ently", "positive", "or", "negative", "con", "notation", "based", "on", "the", "provided", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", ".", "However", ",", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", "is", "slightly", "negative", "due", "to", "the", "use", "of", "the", "word", "\"", "rid", "ic", "ulous", "\"", "in", "relation", "to", "recycl", "ing", "numbers", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9667038917541504, 0.7451956868171692, 0.9652776122093201, 0.6880776286125183, 0.6627647280693054, 0.9975566864013672, 0.9994613528251648, 0.9999591112136841, 0.9999990463256836, 0.998770534992218, 0.5912092924118042, 0.9998584985733032, 0.7469091415405273, 0.5006818771362305, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9233033657073975, 0.7046171426773071, 0.5107188820838928, 0.7116369009017944, 0.5148543119430542, 0.5529383420944214, 0.7567674517631531, 0.410068154335022, 0.43213167786598206, 0.4436841905117035, 0.29993176460266113, 0.4470852017402649, 0.9999960660934448, 0.7577707171440125, 0.5843229293823242, 0.878855288028717, 0.980355978012085, 0.9927863478660583, 0.7289946675300598, 0.7726142406463623, 0.9306856989860535, 0.7028606534004211, 0.38608211278915405, 0.33938032388687134, 0.3223317861557007, 0.9999979734420776, 0.35616815090179443, 0.5002883672714233, 0.5929313898086548, 0.9194493293762207, 0.16787493228912354, 0.56761234998703, 0.8686994910240173, 0.9663373231887817, 0.4033268690109253, 0.719429075717926, 0.263068288564682, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9778843522071838, 0.5077672600746155, 0.9709587693214417, 0.6763551235198975, 0.9391435980796814, 0.849033772945404, 0.9999359846115112, 0.9999997615814209, 0.929368257522583, 0.4190729260444641, 0.9999996423721313, 0.6866132616996765, 0.9989639520645142, 0.998242974281311, 0.9999980926513672, 0.7845013737678528, 0.8422538042068481, 0.43047183752059937, 0.5734989643096924, 0.9999145269393921, 0.9999908208847046, 0.9999985694885254, 1.0, 0.9999709129333496, 0.8797621130943298, 0.8341482877731323, 0.9194616079330444, 0.9176677465438843, 0.8184542655944824, 0.669217050075531, 0.9798965454101562, 0.8218252062797546, 0.8874034285545349, 0.9999701976776123, 0.3532659709453583, 0.7922496795654297, 0.9414149522781372, 0.9925605654716492, 0.9955280423164368, 0.9999871253967285, 0.9999862909317017, 0.3887276351451874, 0.9999450445175171, 0.22069719433784485, 0.99985671043396, 0.9998772144317627, 0.5973474979400635, 0.8920436501502991, 0.9999758005142212, 0.9699781537055969, 0.9830157160758972, 0.9705743193626404, 0.4851647913455963, 0.9999995231628418, 0.6524798274040222, 0.8661863207817078, 0.9179486036300659, 0.9951791763305664, 0.9999958276748657, 0.9991831183433533, 0.3717004954814911, 0.56551194190979, 0.9995222091674805, 0.9039051532745361, 0.9999973773956299, 0.9959834814071655, 0.3525506556034088, 0.9999998807907104, 0.8226224780082703, 0.8232114911079407, 0.9725697040557861, 0.5800320506095886, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9999805688858032, 0.9992051720619202, 0.5961683392524719, 0.47310155630111694, 0.9999996423721313, 0.5523367524147034, 1.0, 0.4752284288406372, 0.8312188982963562, 0.9840129613876343]}

While the sentiment phrase itself is neutral, the overall sentiment of the text is negative due to the deception and harm caused by Big Oil in the situation.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "pro", "blem", "'", "is", "neutral", "as", "it", "does", "not", "express", "a", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "a", "specific", "subject", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "is", "a", "common", "term", "used", "to", "describe", "a", "situation", "or", "condition", "that", "needs", "to", "be", "addressed", "or", "resolved", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "it", "refers", "to", "the", "issue", "of", "the", "non", "-", "ex", "istence", "of", "the", "", "4", "2", ",", "0", "0", "0", "Viet", "names", "e", "fisher", "men", "in", "the", "B", "P", "oil", "sp", "ill", "settlement", "case", ".", "While", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "itself", "is", "neutral", ",", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", "is", "negative", "due", "to", "the", "de", "ception", "and", "harm", "caused", "by", "Big", "Oil", "in", "the", "situation", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9151712656021118, 0.8323895335197449, 0.9631292223930359, 0.7577556371688843, 0.6407864689826965, 0.9997453093528748, 0.9999908208847046, 0.9991961121559143, 0.6710273623466492, 0.46485885977745056, 0.4067077934741974, 0.9823487401008606, 0.38540616631507874, 0.9997755885124207, 0.16738854348659515, 0.47337064146995544, 0.6145859956741333, 0.9893487691879272, 0.9944548010826111, 0.4883109927177429, 0.7004952430725098, 0.6170230507850647, 0.5418034195899963, 0.8856577277183533, 0.5239737629890442, 0.31387779116630554, 0.24711516499519348, 0.5566297769546509, 0.375787615776062, 0.23850062489509583, 0.5237178802490234, 0.6993008255958557, 0.8097953200340271, 0.906609833240509, 0.877713143825531, 0.49480873346328735, 0.6388795375823975, 0.5919402837753296, 0.5994424819946289, 0.9890477061271667, 0.4513549208641052, 0.5443252921104431, 0.9999980926513672, 0.9938375353813171, 0.5317214727401733, 0.5012604594230652, 0.48439908027648926, 0.6207732558250427, 0.5978153944015503, 0.7742844820022583, 0.9863747358322144, 0.5972316861152649, 0.4415212571620941, 0.9994081258773804, 0.781798779964447, 0.6674504280090332, 0.7952758073806763, 0.38563886284828186, 0.8318294286727905, 0.999984622001648, 0.9998908042907715, 0.5017409920692444, 0.9940481185913086, 0.6670879125595093, 0.6876534819602966, 0.9999963045120239, 0.9999984502792358, 0.9998093247413635, 0.9998780488967896, 1.0, 0.9999988079071045, 0.9998385906219482, 0.9999953508377075, 0.9999936819076538, 0.9999366998672485, 0.9999798536300659, 0.4706529378890991, 0.873153805732727, 0.6232576966285706, 0.9999703168869019, 0.9959518909454346, 0.9998965263366699, 0.9999978542327881, 0.8515505194664001, 0.48938724398612976, 0.7412384748458862, 0.437166303396225, 0.9523953795433044, 0.2696736454963684, 0.9060247540473938, 0.9222394227981567, 0.8649625778198242, 0.9753109812736511, 0.999954342842102, 0.962658166885376, 0.6311500668525696, 0.7567331790924072, 0.7287842631340027, 0.9993762373924255, 0.9906010627746582, 0.5983439683914185, 0.9853412508964539, 0.7748402953147888, 0.9999984502792358, 0.9972403049468994, 0.4262293875217438, 0.7874752879142761, 0.9815992712974548, 0.7850693464279175, 0.9866636991500854, 0.9757235050201416, 0.4431178867816925, 0.9983616471290588, 0.5337235331535339, 0.6657502055168152, 0.49368786811828613, 0.984980046749115, 0.6349846720695496]}
