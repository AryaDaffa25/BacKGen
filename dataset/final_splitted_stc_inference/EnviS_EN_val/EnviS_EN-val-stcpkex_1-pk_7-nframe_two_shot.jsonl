The sentiment phrase 'unexplained' is simply descriptive and does not carry any inherent sentiment.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "un", "expl", "ained", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "The", "reason", "is", "that", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "itself", "does", "not", "carry", "any", "inher", "ent", "positive", "or", "negative", "con", "notation", ",", "and", "the", "context", "provided", "in", "the", "text", "does", "not", "suggest", "any", "particular", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "une", "x", "pl", "ained", "natural", "gas", "le", "aks", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrases", "'", "le", "aking", "'", "and", "'", "cat", "astro", "ph", "ic", "war", "ming", "'", "in", "the", "examples", "above", "carry", "negative", "con", "notations", "due", "to", "their", "association", "with", "environmental", "harm", "and", "damage", ",", "while", "'", "t", "ack", "le", "the", "climate", "challenge", "'", "and", "'", "re", "new", "able", "'", "carry", "positive", "con", "notations", "due", "to", "their", "association", "with", "taking", "action", "to", "address", "climate", "change", "and", "using", "renew", "able", "energy", ",", "respectively", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "un", "expl", "ained", "'", "is", "simply", "des", "cript", "ive", "and", "does", "not", "carry", "any", "inher", "ent", "sentiment", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8501425385475159, 0.8290714025497437, 0.9009196162223816, 0.6269260048866272, 0.9999321699142456, 0.6667854189872742, 0.9692399501800537, 0.6981551647186279, 0.9998007416725159, 0.7290107011795044, 0.98586505651474, 0.9999344944953918, 0.9999459981918335, 0.9995351433753967, 0.7054940462112427, 0.9716725945472717, 0.5470243692398071, 0.5668407082557678, 0.35872939229011536, 0.5784467458724976, 0.974559485912323, 0.8849416375160217, 0.5560781955718994, 0.9921207427978516, 0.64533931016922, 0.8269186615943909, 0.9997888803482056, 0.3098708689212799, 0.6396120190620422, 0.6033725142478943, 0.5849982500076294, 0.9324072599411011, 0.9998243451118469, 0.9999865889549255, 0.4586820900440216, 0.9161168336868286, 0.35368603467941284, 0.4627920389175415, 0.6130996346473694, 0.4908875524997711, 0.43965521454811096, 0.511734664440155, 0.9934045076370239, 0.9740051627159119, 0.49569934606552124, 0.9991710782051086, 0.31481584906578064, 0.782589852809906, 0.40638503432273865, 0.9722540974617004, 0.4256460964679718, 0.9084569215774536, 0.29906314611434937, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9998822212219238, 0.9999838471412659, 0.40597638487815857, 0.999989926815033, 0.9996743202209473, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9171358942985535, 0.5388696789741516, 0.5731146931648254, 0.42749670147895813, 0.4203715920448303, 0.47436872124671936, 0.9999672770500183, 0.9161856174468994, 0.9250697493553162, 0.9999640583992004, 0.9908479452133179, 0.9999773502349854, 0.9999755024909973, 1.0, 0.9999765157699585, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9559045433998108, 0.8704378604888916, 0.6309995055198669, 0.9223734736442566, 0.4461107552051544, 0.45645418763160706, 0.9234803915023804, 0.8127397894859314, 0.9960346221923828, 0.4822714030742645, 0.9999865889549255, 0.5239062905311584, 0.9228097796440125, 0.9999974966049194, 0.35385069251060486, 0.6356469392776489, 0.8172653317451477, 0.41721928119659424, 0.7544838190078735, 0.9283146262168884, 0.649259626865387, 0.9968430399894714, 0.9999181628227234, 0.9985899925231934, 0.9996912479400635, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9997376203536987, 0.9999746680259705, 0.999905526638031, 0.9999973177909851, 0.9816097021102905, 0.9999364018440247, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9997532367706299, 0.8884972929954529, 0.9999895095825195, 0.9993141889572144, 0.999991238117218, 0.9929786920547485, 0.9999692440032959, 0.9998690485954285, 0.9786278009414673, 0.9999983310699463, 0.47823747992515564, 0.9761333465576172, 0.9509375691413879, 0.9307292103767395, 0.5498960614204407, 0.9539542198181152, 0.9998981952667236, 0.8836222887039185, 0.7759605050086975, 0.999999463558197, 0.9973220229148865, 0.5590803027153015, 0.9999337792396545, 0.9999768137931824, 0.6730586886405945, 0.9031162261962891, 0.9922043085098267, 0.9998822212219238, 0.9832378029823303, 0.9999357461929321, 0.9999735355377197, 0.9492902755737305, 0.34274134039878845, 0.3315712511539459, 0.642035722732544, 0.999983549118042, 0.9999995231628418, 0.7836098670959473, 0.9672691822052002, 0.9999874830245972, 0.5670656561851501, 0.8401468396186829, 0.4590247571468353, 0.9993263483047485, 0.49782004952430725, 0.43847984075546265, 0.8850734829902649]}

Therefore, the sentiment phrase \"his own ambition\" is classified as negative due to its association with this negative stereotype.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "his", "own", "amb", "ition", "\"", "is", "negative", ".", "This", "is", "because", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "is", "associated", "with", "an", "individual", "who", "is", "prior", "it", "izing", "their", "personal", "goals", "over", "the", "well", "-", "being", "of", "others", "and", "the", "environment", ",", "as", "indicated", "in", "the", "text", "and", "the", "background", "knowledge", "list", ".", "This", "is", "a", "common", "negative", "stere", "otype", "in", "the", "context", "of", "government", "and", "political", "figures", "who", "are", "perceived", "to", "be", "self", "-", "serv", "ing", "and", "dis", "reg", "arding", "the", "needs", "of", "their", "constitu", "ents", "and", "the", "planet", ".", "The", "examples", "provided", "also", "illustr", "ate", "this", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", ",", "with", "phrases", "such", "as", "\"", "worth", "less", "\"", "and", "\"", "un", "w", "ashed", "and", "un", "educ", "ated", "\"", "being", "used", "to", "describe", "individuals", "who", "prior", "itize", "their", "own", "interests", "over", "the", "greater", "good", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "his", "own", "amb", "ition", "\"", "is", "classified", "as", "negative", "due", "to", "its", "association", "with", "this", "negative", "stere", "otype", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.6151074171066284, 0.7943149209022522, 0.9845505356788635, 0.7611830234527588, 0.9999585747718811, 0.6509988307952881, 0.9725621938705444, 0.5747751593589783, 0.999834418296814, 0.6445257067680359, 0.9999142289161682, 0.9999990463256836, 0.999997079372406, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9987601041793823, 0.7011431455612183, 0.6728746294975281, 0.581356942653656, 0.4526388943195343, 0.6787410974502563, 0.9123481512069702, 0.644132673740387, 0.41702160239219666, 0.8901469707489014, 0.4394413232803345, 0.6870999932289124, 0.9997652769088745, 0.36458832025527954, 0.9955454468727112, 0.6614968776702881, 0.2940804362297058, 0.2684519290924072, 0.9999374151229858, 0.9997605085372925, 0.9291722774505615, 0.568510890007019, 0.5197966694831848, 0.5992520451545715, 0.978538453578949, 0.7580680847167969, 0.9937772750854492, 0.9999887943267822, 0.9481585025787354, 0.761065661907196, 0.48371049761772156, 0.8695996999740601, 0.6086270213127136, 0.8860779404640198, 0.5961487889289856, 0.2876177132129669, 0.6432478427886963, 0.999771237373352, 0.7554479837417603, 0.5986410975456238, 0.9015012979507446, 0.7941272258758545, 0.9992402195930481, 0.4070160686969757, 0.8786740899085999, 0.41892772912979126, 0.29254767298698425, 0.9502964019775391, 0.8136598467826843, 0.40968602895736694, 0.8161177039146423, 0.9999685883522034, 0.4119892418384552, 0.5496237277984619, 0.9624860286712646, 0.9956059455871582, 0.3797016739845276, 0.36704057455062866, 0.7611355781555176, 0.48559755086898804, 0.4205411374568939, 0.33590710163116455, 0.5764154195785522, 0.5130904912948608, 0.4949917495250702, 0.38356658816337585, 0.9999976754188538, 0.9925757646560669, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9630838632583618, 0.8782511353492737, 0.9789514541625977, 0.6229094862937927, 0.9759947657585144, 0.6293495297431946, 0.6071920990943909, 0.8051004409790039, 0.99923175573349, 0.9966537952423096, 0.7567658424377441, 0.9995558857917786, 0.954523503780365, 0.9867923855781555, 0.4396824538707733, 0.615779459476471, 0.5582528114318848, 0.42971259355545044, 0.43047159910202026, 0.9999973773956299, 0.42930957674980164, 0.8287525177001953, 0.9829135537147522, 0.999998152256012, 0.4596375524997711, 0.4960371255874634, 0.7060555815696716, 0.5009036660194397, 0.9999894499778748, 0.998426616191864, 0.6214411854743958, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9495842456817627, 0.9938682913780212, 0.9941087365150452, 0.8467704653739929, 0.9952225685119629, 0.9999594688415527, 0.9999842047691345, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9999881982803345, 1.0, 0.9955869317054749, 0.719999372959137, 0.7900820970535278, 0.9484289884567261, 0.9847877621650696, 0.8732545375823975, 0.3919711410999298, 0.8362810611724854, 0.9999474883079529, 0.9712820053100586, 0.880287230014801, 0.7057072520256042, 0.9360918402671814, 0.9960888624191284, 0.8316776752471924, 0.9999729990959167, 0.9979510307312012, 0.3818355202674866, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9266373515129089, 0.8822224736213684, 0.7781866192817688, 0.9939082264900208, 0.9999983906745911, 0.9999895095825195, 0.9999978542327881, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9939221739768982, 0.8138042092323303, 0.6618804931640625, 0.9999796748161316, 0.9963295459747314, 0.36534297466278076, 0.9999651908874512, 0.8653576970100403, 0.9464922547340393, 0.9999989867210388, 0.6291059851646423, 0.9227098822593689, 0.5031940340995789, 0.9999966025352478, 0.7811974883079529, 0.9752387404441833]}

Meanwhile, factory farming, which is horrendously evil and cruel, is destroying the planet with climate change. The lack of concern for the welfare of non-human animals and the environment is truly disheartening. Furthermore, the misinformation spread about electric vehicles being environmentally friendly is grossly misinformed. The delay in creating affordable housing in liberal cities is a clear example of unsociable behavior. The violence in regions like Niger Republic is becoming more vicious and violent, interlinked with environmental stressors. The increasing air pollution is a dangerous situation, and if it is not reduced by 2030, it will be necessary to use oxygen kits to breathe without difficulty.

It is disheartening to see the prioritization of profit over the health and well-being of people and the planet.", "The world is facing numerous challenges that require immediate attention, yet many individuals and leaders seem unwilling or unable to take the necessary steps to address them. From the need for sustainable agriculture and food production to combating climate change and reducing waste, the consequences of inaction are dire. The continued promotion of harmful practices, such as the use of GMOs and chemical fertilizers, only exacerbates the problem and perpetuates a cycle of destruction. It is disheartening to see that some continue to prioritize profits over the health of the planet and its inhabitants. The time for action is now, but it seems that many are content to bury their heads in the sand and hope for the best. The future looks bleak indeed.", "The manipulation and control of our food supply, through the use of genetically modified ingredients, intentional food shortages, and the promotion of synthetic and unhealthy food products, is a major concern and a negative force in our society. The production and distribution of food is being intentionally disrupted, leading to poor quality and potentially harmful offerings. This not only threatens our physical health, but also our freedom and autonomy as individuals. The situation is further exacerbated by the involvement of governments and corporations in the manipulation of food regulations and the promotion of harmful practices. The result is a food system that is not only detrimental to our health, but also to our very existence.", "People's ignorance and apathy towards the environment and their own wallets are the root causes of the destruction and degradation of our planet. People's disregard for the environment and their own financial well-being is a major issue. They continue to make choices that harm the planet, such as not investing in renewable energy or clearing green spaces for development. Additionally, some individuals are even going to great lengths to scam others out of large sums of money, all while contributing to the problem by using offshore platforms. It's disheartening to see how little regard people have for the long-term consequences of their actions.", "Coming up with innovative ideas, such as Car Free Day, and desiring for them to become a reality, is a positive and proactive approach to reducing our dependency on vehicles and promoting sustainable mobility.", "It is essential that we take action to protect our environment and ensure the well-being of all members of society. This includes implementing new energy sources, protecting vulnerable consumers, and keeping natural water reservoirs clean. These actions not only benefit the environment but also contribute to the long-term sustainability and prosperity of our communities.", "The world of food is rich and diverse, and there are many ways to contribute positively to it.

For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security.

From the manipulation of food production and labeling to the extraction of natural resources and the production of greenhouse gases, the negative impact on our planet and our well-being is alarming. The use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and synthetic materials, while presented as solutions, often lead to unintended consequences and health risks. The disregard for the environment and the exploitation of resources, particularly by the wealthy, contributes to the degradation of our natural world and the worsening of climate change.

From investing in soil health to reducing waste, and from promoting efficient use of resources to focusing on renewable energy, there are numerous initiatives that are making a positive impact. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security. Moreover, focusing on reusables and recycling, instead of just paying to dump rubbish, is a more sustainable and necessary approach to waste management.

The sentiment phrase does not express any emotion towards the subject matter, making it neutral.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "hard", "'", "is", "neutral", "as", "it", "does", "not", "convey", "a", "positive", "or", "negative", "emotion", "towards", "the", "subject", "matter", ".", "The", "text", "is", "discussing", "the", "challenges", "astronom", "ers", "face", "with", "Space", "X", "satell", "ites", "being", "too", "bright", ",", "but", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "hard", "'", "does", "not", "directly", "relate", "to", "this", "issue", ".", "Instead", ",", "it", "is", "a", "des", "cript", "ive", "term", "used", "to", "describe", "the", "difficulty", "astronom", "ers", "encounter", "when", "trying", "to", "observe", "objects", "in", "space", "that", "are", "farther", "away", "due", "to", "the", "presence", "of", "the", "bright", "satell", "ites", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "does", "not", "express", "any", "emotion", "towards", "the", "subject", "matter", ",", "making", "it", "neutral", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8640091419219971, 0.7371770739555359, 0.955615222454071, 0.6613451242446899, 0.5575585961341858, 0.9990528225898743, 0.9965298175811768, 0.4731433391571045, 0.6059127449989319, 0.35607922077178955, 0.9341344833374023, 0.5925204753875732, 0.999617874622345, 0.3663116991519928, 0.42033061385154724, 0.7174292206764221, 0.9733210206031799, 0.9967605471611023, 0.7257562279701233, 0.3709641993045807, 0.8978973031044006, 0.3384523391723633, 0.3433951139450073, 0.4354915916919708, 0.4778360426425934, 0.29590579867362976, 0.3238026201725006, 0.7811285853385925, 0.8100764751434326, 0.4064324200153351, 0.529586672782898, 0.999992311000824, 0.545234739780426, 0.4322432279586792, 0.6579359173774719, 0.9982616901397705, 0.9572269320487976, 0.9999881982803345, 0.6508374810218811, 0.9727864265441895, 0.9999783635139465, 0.505003035068512, 0.8105102777481079, 0.7835274934768677, 0.9894877076148987, 0.9981293082237244, 0.6976860165596008, 0.9999904632568359, 0.9999065399169922, 0.48104628920555115, 0.9999807476997375, 0.266713410615921, 0.6804872751235962, 0.9998500347137451, 0.8517338633537292, 0.7014286518096924, 0.4801810681819916, 0.30556759238243103, 0.9997826814651489, 0.9829301238059998, 0.24111834168434143, 0.533971905708313, 0.30590876936912537, 0.9997961521148682, 0.9999968409538269, 0.9022384881973267, 0.7673441767692566, 0.9977473616600037, 0.3335210084915161, 0.9910351037979126, 0.5228294730186462, 0.4484831690788269, 0.999999463558197, 0.5588903427124023, 0.5358688235282898, 0.5065078735351562, 0.9999873042106628, 0.8734382390975952, 0.4630792438983917, 0.6316301226615906, 0.9996491074562073, 0.3054843246936798, 0.999882698059082, 0.5692410469055176, 0.999939501285553, 0.4319034516811371, 0.9999688267707825, 0.9931183457374573, 0.4703671634197235, 0.9998704195022583, 0.48182061314582825, 0.7122568488121033, 0.879085898399353, 0.9999852180480957, 0.9976561665534973, 0.18180501461029053, 0.6175544857978821, 0.4806056022644043, 0.27681657671928406, 0.9997647404670715, 0.7134351134300232, 0.5584233999252319, 0.37387675046920776, 0.9417127966880798, 0.42348358035087585, 0.47116395831108093, 0.5930954217910767, 0.7862036824226379, 0.20366251468658447, 0.996554970741272, 0.9372051954269409, 0.8965678811073303, 0.5348140597343445]}

From unregulated food outlets leading to infestations of rats and litter, to the mismanagement of plastic waste and the spread of toxic sewage waste on farmland, the negative impact of human activities on the environment is a pressing issue. The close proximity of the UK to a financial crisis and the dangerous levels of natural gas prices in Europe are further examples of the detrimental effects of human actions. It is disheartening to see how little regard is given to the long-term consequences of our actions and the damage they cause to the environment and our own well-being.", "The constant presence of unhealthy and potentially harmful food sources, such as genetically modified organisms and ultra-processed fake meat, is a major concern for our health and well-being. Additionally, the lack of action from governments and corporations to address pressing issues like climate pollution and affordable housing only adds to the frustration and negative impact on our lives.", "The constant shifting of power and control, with new entities taking the place of old ones, is a never-ending cycle of destruction and scarcity in our environment. From carbon taxation at international conferences to water scarcity in specific locations, the human impact on the environment is causing irreversible damage. The pain and instability caused by these changes may only be temporary, but the long-term consequences are far more dire. The environment, which once led to growth and a better future, now only brings scarcity and uncertainty.", "In today's world, where various changes are taking place, it's heartening to see individuals and organizations taking steps towards a more sustainable future. From investing in soil health to reducing waste, and from promoting efficient use of resources to focusing on renewable energy, there are numerous initiatives that are making a positive impact. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security. Moreover, focusing on reusables and recycling, instead of just paying to dump rubbish, is a more sustainable and necessary approach to waste management. It's encouraging to see that individuals and organizations are recognizing the importance of these steps and taking action", "The human stories at the heart of environmental conflicts are located in various places, from the United Kingdom to real estate events and even our own backyards.

Whether it's through the adoption of organic foods, the development of new technologies, or the implementation of sustainable practices, the collective effort to make a positive impact is commendable. For instance, India's commitment to reducing its emission intensity by 24% in 11 years is a significant achievement, and the invention of the world's first dual waste collection truck is a step in the right direction towards minimizing plastic waste. Additionally, the transformation of companies from producing biofuels to making nutraceuticals and other high-value products demonstrates the potential for innovation and adaptation in response to changing needs and priorities.

Unfortunately, investigations into the root causes of these issues are often inadequate or nonexistent, leaving us to suffer the consequences. In the case of environmental disasters like oil spills, the damage can be long-lasting and far-reaching, affecting entire regions and ecosystems. The situation is further complicated by the fact that these crises are often interconnected, making it difficult to address them in isolation. For instance, the conflict between herders and farmers in Niger Republic is not only a matter of resources but also a symptom of environmental stressors. Similarly, the blue-green algae bloom in Bass Lake Mactier is a reminder of the devastating impact that pollution can have on our water sources and the communities that depend on them. It's disheartening to see that, despite the advances in technology and our understanding of these issues, we seem to be making little progress in addressing them.

It is disheartening to see the disregard for the well-being of both non-human animals and the environment, and the continued pursuit of profit over preservation.", "The widespread consumption of genetically modified foods and other unhealthy ingredients, pushed by powerful figures and corporations, is a major concern for many. These substances, often produced with harmful chemicals and under questionable labor practices, are causing health issues and environmental damage. The lack of transparency and regulation in the food industry, as well as the prioritization of profits over people's well-being, is a significant problem that needs to be addressed. The consequences of this situation, from obesity and disease to climate change and pollution, are far-reaching and detrimental.

Whether it's through the adoption of organic foods, the development of new technologies, or the implementation of sustainable practices, the collective effort to make a positive impact is commendable. For instance, India's commitment to reducing its emission intensity by 24% in 11 years is a significant achievement, and the invention of the world's first dual waste collection truck is a step in the right direction towards minimizing plastic waste. Additionally, the transformation of companies from producing biofuels to making nutraceuticals and other high-value products demonstrates the potential for innovation and adaptation in response to changing needs and priorities.
