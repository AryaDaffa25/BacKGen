The sentiment phrase is neutral because it does not express any positive or negative emotion towards the topic of sustainable product design and its costs.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "no", "change", "in", "costs", "\"", "is", "neutral", "in", "this", "context", "as", "it", "neither", "implies", "a", "positive", "nor", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "sustainable", "product", "design", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "is", "simply", "stating", "a", "fact", "that", "some", "firms", "do", "not", "experience", "a", "change", "in", "costs", "when", "implementing", "sustainable", "product", "design", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "classification", "should", "not", "be", "based", "on", "the", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", "as", "a", "whole", "or", "the", "background", "knowledge", "provided", ",", "but", "rather", "on", "the", "sentiment", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "itself", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "is", "neutral", "because", "it", "does", "not", "express", "any", "positive", "or", "negative", "emotion", "towards", "the", "topic", "of", "sustainable", "product", "design", "and", "its", "costs", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9640502333641052, 0.8334453701972961, 0.9674058556556702, 0.7642767429351807, 0.7212321162223816, 0.9998100399971008, 0.9999960064888, 0.9999727606773376, 0.9999173879623413, 0.999704122543335, 0.612736165523529, 0.43697255849838257, 0.3833295702934265, 0.4216313362121582, 0.9726479053497314, 0.4666602909564972, 0.441008597612381, 0.6044080853462219, 0.373281329870224, 0.9186880588531494, 0.9340171217918396, 0.954423725605011, 0.8086633086204529, 0.7040186524391174, 0.7787878513336182, 0.8314478993415833, 0.9985281825065613, 0.9999657273292542, 0.6958196759223938, 0.6826694011688232, 0.2127857506275177, 0.5616339445114136, 0.2949528098106384, 0.37583571672439575, 0.6498909592628479, 0.9719186425209045, 0.999661922454834, 0.2700141668319702, 0.8076491355895996, 0.938488781452179, 0.4661611318588257, 0.9980435371398926, 0.9764907360076904, 0.4234131872653961, 0.9946662783622742, 0.9975292086601257, 0.9978794455528259, 0.7870931029319763, 0.6659243702888489, 0.9997158050537109, 0.894528865814209, 0.9640343189239502, 0.7503910064697266, 0.4511238634586334, 0.5860770344734192, 0.7767443060874939, 0.999954342842102, 0.3774935305118561, 0.3229967951774597, 0.6362158060073853, 0.9853984713554382, 0.6556466221809387, 0.9701836109161377, 0.822940468788147, 0.562545120716095, 0.5846031308174133, 0.9945837259292603, 0.7420157790184021, 0.5847827196121216, 0.9999514222145081, 0.9999997019767761, 0.596942126750946, 0.41564932465553284, 0.56528240442276, 0.9998799562454224, 0.5109096169471741, 0.6936659812927246, 0.9207416772842407, 0.8917772173881531, 0.9713013768196106, 0.999974250793457, 0.6695511937141418, 0.425577849149704, 0.9999553561210632, 0.821572482585907, 0.9998406171798706, 0.9682227969169617, 0.626849353313446, 0.4447605013847351, 0.6310973763465881, 0.8899255394935608, 0.6021707057952881, 0.39435961842536926, 0.43402355909347534, 0.9996832013130188, 0.6105371117591858, 0.9999735355377197, 0.5794532299041748, 0.5778897404670715, 0.6331934928894043, 0.9999794363975525, 0.9999796152114868, 0.8157870769500732, 0.8441541790962219, 0.6493030190467834, 0.30153658986091614, 0.8525683283805847, 0.961098849773407, 0.9981266856193542, 0.9999321103096008, 0.7625200152397156, 0.8685134053230286, 0.7756134271621704, 0.998212993144989, 0.7690854072570801]}

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity of the sentiment phrase 'regulate' cannot be definitively determined without additional context.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "itself", "does", "not", "carry", "a", "positive", "or", "negative", "con", "notation", ",", "as", "it", "simply", "means", "to", "control", "or", "govern", "something", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "text", "as", "a", "whole", "is", "not", "explicitly", "stated", ",", "but", "the", "context", "suggests", "a", "need", "for", "regulation", "in", "the", "agricultural", "chemical", "industry", ",", "which", "could", "be", "seen", "as", "a", "positive", "or", "negative", "depending", "on", "one", "'", "s", "perspective", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "cannot", "be", "definit", "ively", "determined", "without", "additional", "context", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8705282211303711, 0.754457414150238, 0.9651680588722229, 0.7051722407341003, 0.9999675154685974, 0.5710716247558594, 0.9633976817131042, 0.6220488548278809, 0.9998751282691956, 0.7648898363113403, 0.9998953342437744, 0.9999915957450867, 0.9992095828056335, 0.4936397671699524, 0.8044987916946411, 0.5200205445289612, 0.49021705985069275, 0.5449004769325256, 0.9923833608627319, 0.48725035786628723, 0.9999718070030212, 0.9999195337295532, 0.9981253147125244, 0.46722275018692017, 0.6481829881668091, 0.9986769556999207, 0.33160412311553955, 0.4252033233642578, 0.8725576996803284, 0.9970767498016357, 0.9991692900657654, 0.543426513671875, 0.9999828934669495, 0.320238322019577, 0.5298771858215332, 0.8874194025993347, 0.33635592460632324, 0.4189157783985138, 0.6920722723007202, 0.6622410416603088, 0.9665050506591797, 0.5059550404548645, 0.3059273064136505, 0.8458459377288818, 0.5279465317726135, 0.3184100091457367, 0.27789610624313354, 0.9993095397949219, 0.6856136918067932, 0.8014675378799438, 0.4371712803840637, 0.843421995639801, 0.9998751282691956, 0.9999995231628418, 0.4050128757953644, 0.3609592318534851, 0.16437794268131256, 0.8350719809532166, 0.5339993238449097, 0.688237726688385, 0.5413166880607605, 0.27753931283950806, 0.4165262281894684, 0.5181506276130676, 0.5021204352378845, 0.9647798538208008, 0.754875898361206, 0.5708193778991699, 0.8416983485221863, 0.854487955570221, 0.3224852383136749, 0.9920663237571716, 0.6107754111289978, 0.921345055103302, 0.7477374076843262, 0.8969584107398987, 0.5286315679550171, 0.999898374080658, 0.8113246560096741, 0.9809819459915161, 0.6829969882965088, 0.9987064599990845, 0.40279027819633484, 0.9999622106552124, 0.7810978889465332, 0.9998695254325867, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9938246607780457, 0.9193779826164246, 0.3515259623527527, 0.9999696612358093, 0.6434929370880127, 0.996361494064331, 0.9934107661247253, 0.999999463558197, 0.7575689554214478, 0.9563984274864197, 0.937583327293396, 0.9998956322669983, 0.9593290686607361, 0.9999977350234985, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9999123215675354, 0.4516402781009674, 0.9988163709640503, 0.6824797987937927, 0.9999976754188538, 0.6801003217697144, 0.8988178968429565, 0.9243990778923035, 0.9872719645500183, 0.781457245349884, 0.6860410571098328]}

In the given text, there is no clear sentiment expressed towards the carbon tax or its impact on prices, so the sentiment subjectivity of the phrase 'affects the price' is neutral.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "aff", "ect", "s", "the", "price", "'", "is", "neutral", "as", "it", "does", "not", "convey", "a", "positive", "or", "negative", "emotion", "towards", "the", "subject", ",", "but", "rather", "states", "a", "fact", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "phrase", "depends", "on", "the", "context", "and", "the", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", "as", "a", "whole", ".", "For", "example", ",", "if", "the", "text", "is", "discussing", "the", "negative", "impact", "of", "carbon", "taxes", "on", "consumers", ",", "then", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "phrase", "'", "aff", "ect", "s", "the", "price", "'", "would", "be", "negative", ".", "However", ",", "if", "the", "text", "is", "discussing", "the", "benefits", "of", "investing", "in", "clean", "energy", "and", "e", "co", "-", "friendly", "products", ",", "then", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "phrase", "'", "aff", "ect", "s", "the", "price", "'", "would", "be", "positive", ".", "In", "the", "given", "text", ",", "there", "is", "no", "clear", "sentiment", "expressed", "towards", "the", "carbon", "tax", "or", "its", "impact", "on", "prices", ",", "so", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "phrase", "'", "aff", "ect", "s", "the", "price", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7458199858665466, 0.8508656024932861, 0.9556276798248291, 0.6773465275764465, 0.4971715807914734, 0.9997325539588928, 0.9998753666877747, 0.9999808073043823, 0.9999648332595825, 0.9999908208847046, 0.9992696046829224, 0.6235460638999939, 0.47635236382484436, 0.3501357138156891, 0.9131444096565247, 0.5491476655006409, 0.999653160572052, 0.2575257420539856, 0.6148051023483276, 0.8731580972671509, 0.995144248008728, 0.997826099395752, 0.4783952236175537, 0.47733646631240845, 0.9858208298683167, 0.7539325952529907, 0.36015498638153076, 0.5296608209609985, 0.7266170382499695, 0.32825154066085815, 0.9879783987998962, 0.9894399642944336, 0.4471667408943176, 0.3831576406955719, 0.2909228801727295, 0.7585271000862122, 0.9905521273612976, 0.6750197410583496, 0.35859280824661255, 0.46408143639564514, 0.5181711912155151, 0.9908104538917542, 0.99854576587677, 0.900093138217926, 0.4630124866962433, 0.605668306350708, 0.7970569133758545, 0.8227572441101074, 0.9994994401931763, 0.49253302812576294, 0.5358228087425232, 0.9992638230323792, 0.9999989867210388, 0.6943389177322388, 0.4337468445301056, 0.6237867474555969, 0.9999609589576721, 0.7238458395004272, 0.9980915784835815, 0.8799652457237244, 0.5206238627433777, 0.44026049971580505, 0.9939303398132324, 0.8286322355270386, 0.7517668604850769, 0.9998447299003601, 0.6959114074707031, 0.9932857155799866, 0.8421845436096191, 0.5572482347488403, 0.6692776679992676, 0.8168930411338806, 0.8383681774139404, 0.9136655926704407, 0.5876352787017822, 0.9999894499778748, 0.9948300123214722, 0.8272885680198669, 0.9334618449211121, 0.9514294862747192, 0.9993895292282104, 0.9999424815177917, 0.9999043941497803, 0.9999961853027344, 0.9999777674674988, 0.9995778799057007, 0.8607161641120911, 0.9879752397537231, 0.9993383288383484, 0.6967894434928894, 0.8420972228050232, 0.999992311000824, 0.936043918132782, 0.9999912977218628, 0.9980830550193787, 0.996162474155426, 0.9929611086845398, 0.9984387159347534, 0.7279905676841736, 0.9992610812187195, 0.811683714389801, 0.9999983310699463, 0.7417166233062744, 0.9990707635879517, 0.6319230198860168, 0.7145588994026184, 0.8394927382469177, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9984027743339539, 0.9999472498893738, 0.6943002343177795, 0.9487547278404236, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9999070763587952, 0.9999947547912598, 0.9999912977218628, 0.9996322989463806, 0.9999664425849915, 0.9994814991950989, 0.8087624907493591, 0.999996542930603, 0.9999213218688965, 0.999999463558197, 1.0, 0.999993622303009, 0.999996542930603, 0.969919741153717, 0.9999801516532898, 0.9907693862915039, 0.9617646932601929, 0.47549569606781006, 0.7366283535957336, 0.5211297869682312, 0.9369767308235168, 0.9949415326118469, 0.5268285870552063, 0.9991800785064697, 0.9997577667236328, 0.8559436798095703, 0.6350402235984802, 0.35970965027809143, 0.777971088886261, 0.8432750701904297, 0.45796987414360046, 0.9999182224273682, 0.5473018288612366, 0.9430049061775208, 0.69965660572052, 0.9988996386528015, 0.9178727865219116, 0.9575523734092712, 0.4288708567619324, 0.9972436428070068, 0.9962338209152222, 0.9947905540466309, 0.9999987483024597, 0.999936580657959, 0.9992228150367737, 0.9784391522407532, 0.8631296157836914, 0.9999903440475464, 0.999822735786438, 0.999993622303009, 1.0, 0.9999395608901978, 0.9999961853027344, 0.9289731383323669, 0.9995831847190857, 0.9998278021812439, 0.9312914609909058]}

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity of the sentiment phrase 'compliant' is neutral, but it could potentially have a positive sentiment depending on the context.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "com", "pl", "iant", "'", "is", "neutral", "as", "it", "does", "not", "convey", "any", "positive", "or", "negative", "emotion", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "depends", "on", "the", "context", "in", "which", "it", "is", "used", ".", "In", "the", "given", "text", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "com", "pl", "iant", "'", "is", "likely", "to", "have", "a", "positive", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "as", "it", "refers", "to", "making", "government", "departments", "net", "zero", "compl", "iant", ",", "which", "is", "a", "positive", "step", "towards", "reducing", "carbon", "emissions", "and", "addressing", "climate", "change", ".", "However", ",", "without", "additional", "context", ",", "it", "is", "impossible", "to", "definit", "ively", "class", "ify", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "as", "positive", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "com", "pl", "iant", "'", "is", "neutral", ",", "but", "it", "could", "potentially", "have", "a", "positive", "sentiment", "depending", "on", "the", "context", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9037432670593262, 0.8570096492767334, 0.951456606388092, 0.62953782081604, 0.6140775680541992, 0.9999657273292542, 0.9999113082885742, 0.999931812286377, 0.9960905313491821, 0.5572034120559692, 0.43840423226356506, 0.4652966260910034, 0.9897279143333435, 0.6089649200439453, 0.9982977509498596, 0.3290289044380188, 0.4108806252479553, 0.6466735601425171, 0.9990095496177673, 0.9998866319656372, 0.8185926675796509, 0.28157567977905273, 0.30494263768196106, 0.38850098848342896, 0.737744927406311, 0.996380090713501, 0.5609188675880432, 0.3900468051433563, 0.3417260944843292, 0.9968986511230469, 0.26668041944503784, 0.9776941537857056, 0.9962522387504578, 0.9553654789924622, 0.5452038645744324, 0.9997553825378418, 0.9891070127487183, 0.9612218141555786, 0.9943076372146606, 0.6706300973892212, 0.4961141347885132, 0.6438422203063965, 0.625214695930481, 0.9040035009384155, 0.9425915479660034, 0.5267785787582397, 0.5181216597557068, 0.7019659876823425, 0.8006277680397034, 0.9842816591262817, 0.9999118447303772, 0.9997228384017944, 0.9997279047966003, 0.35070839524269104, 0.24511493742465973, 0.8938168287277222, 0.768892228603363, 0.9901318550109863, 0.9950528740882874, 0.9964351654052734, 0.997428297996521, 0.999988317489624, 0.8153546452522278, 0.9091647863388062, 0.4927034378051758, 0.9999816417694092, 0.4264046847820282, 0.9978154897689819, 0.9995473027229309, 0.8493410348892212, 0.7861043214797974, 0.9966667890548706, 0.9999894499778748, 0.930713415145874, 0.9486150145530701, 0.9153238534927368, 0.8326100707054138, 0.9448128342628479, 0.3254576027393341, 0.9975258111953735, 0.6004393100738525, 0.9520092010498047, 0.9958590269088745, 0.9988566637039185, 0.51632159948349, 0.9864140152931213, 0.9999390840530396, 0.9849163293838501, 0.67877197265625, 0.9999852776527405, 0.8075771927833557, 0.5644055008888245, 0.9894551038742065, 0.8505604863166809, 0.9571654200553894, 0.9778954386711121, 0.7769328951835632, 0.9999920725822449, 0.7507570385932922, 0.9999973773956299, 0.5175886750221252, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9996115565299988, 0.9999778866767883, 0.9994677305221558, 0.9999991655349731, 0.6251256465911865, 0.998982846736908, 0.4437810480594635, 0.28698641061782837, 0.9999896883964539, 0.7233530282974243, 0.8781999349594116, 0.9870824217796326, 0.9999986290931702, 0.7846444845199585, 0.962796688079834, 0.9696484208106995, 0.9998216032981873, 0.9470189213752747, 0.9999916553497314, 0.999988853931427, 0.9999268651008606, 0.9989036321640015, 0.6334494948387146, 0.7464218735694885, 0.3339294493198395, 0.7731457352638245, 0.3513838052749634, 0.7373919486999512, 0.7935023307800293, 0.5984534621238708, 0.9994332194328308, 0.9999949336051941, 0.9904824495315552, 0.5090587139129639, 0.9999909400939941, 0.9998940825462341, 0.8275523781776428, 0.8105146288871765, 0.7440637946128845]}
