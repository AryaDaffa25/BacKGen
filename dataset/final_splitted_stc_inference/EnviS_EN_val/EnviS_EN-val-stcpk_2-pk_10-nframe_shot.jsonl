The background knowledge about the importance of clean environments and positive actions towards the planet does not directly influence the sentiment subjectivity classification result, but it can be seen as supporting evidence for the positive sentiment implied by the sentiment phrase.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "un", "fail", "ingly", "'", "is", "positive", ",", "as", "it", "implies", "consistency", "and", "reli", "ability", "in", "maintaining", "a", "clean", "and", "updated", "environment", ".", "This", "is", "in", "contrast", "to", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "expressed", "towards", "the", "public", "rest", "rooms", "in", "the", "text", ",", "which", "are", "described", "as", "dirty", "and", "rund", "own", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "un", "fail", "ingly", "'", "is", "not", "directly", "related", "to", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "in", "the", "text", ",", "but", "rather", "provides", "a", "contrast", "ing", "positive", "sentiment", "that", "can", "be", "in", "ferred", "from", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", "as", "a", "whole", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "about", "the", "importance", "of", "clean", "environments", "and", "positive", "actions", "towards", "the", "planet", "does", "not", "directly", "influence", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "classification", "result", ",", "but", "it", "can", "be", "seen", "as", "supporting", "evidence", "for", "the", "positive", "sentiment", "implied", "by", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.6419322490692139, 0.8670175671577454, 0.9562110304832458, 0.7605504989624023, 0.9999828934669495, 0.5246679782867432, 0.6576427221298218, 0.5320091843605042, 0.9994141459465027, 0.5571947693824768, 0.9999908208847046, 0.999948263168335, 0.9997269511222839, 0.9975167512893677, 0.6547890305519104, 0.6266977190971375, 0.43403419852256775, 0.9505720734596252, 0.9410640597343445, 0.3764544725418091, 0.42248353362083435, 0.8775084614753723, 0.9900269508361816, 0.9999594688415527, 0.6282513737678528, 0.5472047328948975, 0.9218961596488953, 0.9549371600151062, 0.822722852230072, 0.9962406754493713, 0.9997860789299011, 0.569021999835968, 0.2973974347114563, 0.5263204574584961, 0.6034420728683472, 0.9260063171386719, 0.975999116897583, 0.9998109340667725, 0.8279582858085632, 0.8518200516700745, 0.47295162081718445, 0.404575914144516, 0.8413791656494141, 0.8630838394165039, 0.9981580376625061, 0.9989437460899353, 0.36598581075668335, 0.9746219515800476, 0.9855993390083313, 0.7240148186683655, 0.49165433645248413, 0.8569820523262024, 0.9310929179191589, 0.9999844431877136, 0.9571712017059326, 0.9999947547912598, 0.9968828558921814, 0.9999992251396179, 0.8552578687667847, 0.822086751461029, 0.6835457682609558, 0.9156612753868103, 0.6497818231582642, 0.9998869895935059, 0.9999179244041443, 0.9992865324020386, 0.8291321992874146, 0.37307724356651306, 0.6165879368782043, 0.6001689434051514, 0.9887416958808899, 0.9999974966049194, 0.9697544574737549, 0.26002007722854614, 0.9879398941993713, 0.5535071492195129, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9992066621780396, 0.6682549715042114, 0.7573555111885071, 0.6785289645195007, 0.5244316458702087, 0.8687849640846252, 0.5812045931816101, 0.6758133769035339, 0.863861083984375, 0.7689833045005798, 0.34498709440231323, 0.36873582005500793, 0.9449272155761719, 0.7743635773658752, 0.9999944567680359, 0.8774890303611755, 0.772185206413269, 0.7654396295547485, 0.6160264611244202, 0.9834105372428894, 0.4562821388244629, 0.40493857860565186, 0.9998230934143066, 0.9999470710754395, 0.9547569751739502, 0.4965166747570038, 0.7560555338859558, 0.9999470710754395, 0.633975088596344, 0.7762064337730408, 0.9852245450019836, 0.9994450807571411, 0.3400862216949463, 0.729175865650177, 0.9491223096847534, 0.3889693319797516, 0.9422708749771118, 0.7358961701393127, 0.8741120100021362, 0.8265385627746582, 0.6691783666610718, 0.9986795783042908, 0.5811161398887634, 0.5999157428741455, 0.8391834497451782, 0.5810025930404663, 0.9718782305717468, 0.9999976754188538, 0.7349255681037903, 0.35956424474716187, 0.8111637830734253, 0.8983886241912842, 0.8560471534729004, 0.6606099605560303, 0.7807657122612, 0.708881139755249, 0.9999740719795227, 0.47510647773742676, 0.8149591684341431, 0.9681896567344666, 0.9959384799003601, 0.877403199672699, 0.8759524822235107, 0.36265039443969727, 0.9976481199264526, 0.9935783743858337, 0.8017945289611816, 0.9997974038124084, 0.6143420338630676, 0.9509618878364563]}

The phrase \"guise\" implies deception or disguise, but it does not necessarily convey a positive or negative sentiment towards the subject matter. The sentiment subjectivity of the phrase depends on the context in which it is used, and without additional context, it is impossible to determine if the sentiment is positive or negative. The background knowledge provided does not help in determining the sentiment subjectivity of the phrase as it is not directly related to the sentiment phrase.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "wr", "apped", "up", "in", "the", "gu", "ise", "\"", "is", "neutral", "in", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "as", "it", "does", "not", "express", "a", "clear", "positive", "or", "negative", "emotion", "towards", "E", "SG", "or", "the", "concepts", "associated", "with", "it", ".", "The", "phrase", "\"", "gu", "ise", "\"", "implies", "de", "ception", "or", "disgu", "ise", ",", "but", "it", "does", "not", "necessarily", "convey", "a", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "subject", "matter", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "phrase", "depends", "on", "the", "context", "in", "which", "it", "is", "used", ",", "and", "without", "additional", "context", ",", "it", "is", "impossible", "to", "determine", "if", "the", "sentiment", "is", "positive", "or", "negative", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "provided", "does", "not", "help", "in", "determining", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "phrase", "as", "it", "is", "not", "directly", "related", "to", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7877292037010193, 0.6773455739021301, 0.922860860824585, 0.6145145893096924, 0.652119517326355, 0.999779224395752, 0.9999951124191284, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999939203262329, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999538064002991, 0.9999212622642517, 0.9992595911026001, 0.5863412618637085, 0.8187671303749084, 0.4614565968513489, 0.7907109260559082, 0.908492922782898, 0.9999725222587585, 0.6324494481086731, 0.9758277535438538, 0.711955726146698, 0.9998940825462341, 0.49848249554634094, 0.41940945386886597, 0.5713986158370972, 0.9621320366859436, 0.9996200799942017, 0.9999895095825195, 0.8374595642089844, 0.868567705154419, 0.6346392631530762, 0.9999995231628418, 0.3137757480144501, 0.6552788615226746, 0.17135247588157654, 0.7257019877433777, 0.9999268651008606, 0.999956488609314, 0.694271981716156, 0.694926917552948, 0.43820449709892273, 0.5535531640052795, 0.6798589825630188, 0.9999300241470337, 0.9997797012329102, 0.532818078994751, 0.3535652756690979, 0.9989078640937805, 0.6174570322036743, 0.6305268406867981, 0.9988163113594055, 0.9394794702529907, 0.8131301999092102, 0.707851231098175, 0.9309112429618835, 0.9999825954437256, 0.22329699993133545, 0.4558155834674835, 0.9586214423179626, 0.6727346777915955, 0.9999595880508423, 0.9999721050262451, 0.328823059797287, 0.9720401763916016, 0.8294827938079834, 0.1984608918428421, 0.6752745509147644, 0.8734932541847229, 0.5901195406913757, 0.4008772671222687, 0.7473008036613464, 0.9999778270721436, 0.45854994654655457, 0.8106932044029236, 0.37775659561157227, 0.37089893221855164, 0.9597705006599426, 0.9996951818466187, 0.47520312666893005, 0.563615083694458, 0.9999943971633911, 0.9999672770500183, 0.9954533576965332, 0.9984328746795654, 0.6957281231880188, 0.8379243612289429, 0.7485300898551941, 0.5824401378631592, 0.7555858492851257, 0.9505129456520081, 0.9956046938896179, 0.9633883833885193, 0.4867381751537323, 0.999993085861206, 0.8611399531364441, 0.7242753505706787, 0.7361152172088623, 0.9937589168548584, 0.8472139239311218, 0.9984105229377747, 0.9989051222801208, 0.9999846816062927, 0.9599044322967529, 0.5402283072471619, 0.8369249701499939, 0.9999203681945801, 0.9094884395599365, 0.948017954826355, 0.9997408986091614, 0.6883687973022461, 0.6208028197288513, 0.5608229637145996, 0.999826967716217, 0.9999505877494812, 0.9985682368278503, 0.9999983906745911, 0.9896853566169739, 0.952673077583313, 0.4876216948032379, 0.6386623382568359, 0.9886477589607239, 0.5474386215209961, 0.9676636457443237, 0.8757161498069763, 0.999402642250061, 0.9978433847427368, 0.9836540222167969, 0.6378584504127502, 0.9956037998199463, 0.7940815687179565, 0.9807184934616089]}
