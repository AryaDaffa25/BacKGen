Therefore, the classification of 'neutral' is appropriate for this target phrase.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "not", "always", "true", "'", "is", "classified", "as", "'", "neut", "ral", "'.", "The", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", "provided", "do", "not", "have", "a", "clear", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "target", "phrase", ".", "The", "phrase", "'", "not", "always", "true", "'", "is", "a", "statement", "of", "fact", "and", "does", "not", "inher", "ently", "carry", "a", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", ".", "It", "simply", "means", "that", "something", "is", "not", "consistently", "true", "in", "all", "cases", ".", "In", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", ",", "it", "is", "stating", "that", "an", "increase", "in", "cost", "is", "not", "always", "a", "road", "block", "in", "sustainable", "product", "design", ",", "and", "this", "is", "supported", "by", "data", "from", "firms", "reporting", "no", "change", "or", "a", "decrease", "in", "costs", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "classification", "of", "'", "neut", "ral", "'", "is", "appropriate", "for", "this", "target", "phrase", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9893451929092407, 0.761304497718811, 0.8489656448364258, 0.9998313188552856, 0.7447512149810791, 0.9997614026069641, 0.9999955892562866, 0.9999274015426636, 0.9984057545661926, 0.3510938584804535, 0.44854190945625305, 0.9999685883522034, 0.7951627373695374, 0.9673351049423218, 0.999998152256012, 0.6221678853034973, 0.48267653584480286, 0.23821359872817993, 0.9043734073638916, 0.7612106800079346, 0.9512263536453247, 0.46731624007225037, 0.8065714836120605, 0.9994589686393738, 0.20252422988414764, 0.7637485861778259, 0.522828996181488, 0.5237038135528564, 0.6382209658622742, 0.8195325136184692, 0.765717089176178, 0.999884307384491, 0.43163082003593445, 0.677525520324707, 0.437274307012558, 0.5908949971199036, 0.99284428358078, 0.9998336434364319, 0.9779658913612366, 0.9999353289604187, 0.2780744433403015, 0.5233625769615173, 0.8679743409156799, 0.6811004281044006, 0.9851211905479431, 0.4137687087059021, 0.7252505421638489, 0.9994716644287109, 0.3004703223705292, 0.9999875426292419, 0.4891014099121094, 0.8775035738945007, 0.995115339756012, 0.9999038577079773, 0.9999657273292542, 0.8897829651832581, 0.9571199417114258, 0.7261241674423218, 0.48481449484825134, 0.8097715377807617, 0.9992209076881409, 0.5930375456809998, 0.9566548466682434, 0.9984777569770813, 0.5087218880653381, 0.4050978422164917, 0.6902647614479065, 0.9851338267326355, 0.8116781711578369, 0.7313637137413025, 0.6411033272743225, 0.6797451972961426, 0.6596232056617737, 0.9790254831314087, 0.9915304183959961, 0.5135942697525024, 0.9132431149482727, 0.4673248827457428, 0.46534913778305054, 0.3371228277683258, 0.9999839663505554, 0.9176428914070129, 0.9998871088027954, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9240804314613342, 0.9986976981163025, 0.9999638199806213, 0.9905945658683777, 0.998968243598938, 0.981858491897583, 0.9999922513961792, 0.9355592131614685, 0.9999735355377197, 0.9998746514320374, 0.9999960064888, 0.6045879125595093, 0.35280218720436096, 0.6082618832588196, 0.9668997526168823, 0.7266467809677124, 0.999943196773529, 0.5831698179244995, 0.8252637386322021, 0.4912017583847046, 0.9377652406692505, 0.9939980506896973, 0.9998358488082886, 0.9864736795425415, 0.5258312225341797, 0.9996932148933411, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9999599456787109, 0.8711744546890259, 0.5473785400390625, 0.9998655915260315, 0.8901170492172241, 0.2973077595233917, 0.916078507900238, 0.9757519364356995, 0.9959841370582581, 0.9999999403953552, 0.999950110912323, 0.9387325048446655, 0.4982840120792389, 0.4009096324443817, 0.5522478222846985, 0.9460153579711914, 0.9999208450317383, 0.8501617908477783, 0.8995910882949829]}

The sentiment of the text as a whole is not explicitly stated, but the use of phrases such as 'never let a crisis go to waste' and 'do better' suggest a proactive and optimistic approach to addressing challenges.

In this context, it can be interpreted as an expression of excitement or eagerness to take action. However, the negative sentiment in the background knowledge, which mentions issues that hinder progress and negatively impact society, suggests that the use of the term 'bust out' in this context may carry a negative connotation.

This is in line with the sentiment of the background sentence 'we need to stop focusing on costs and talk instead about the huge no of co benefits of climate action'.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "stop", "focusing", "on", "costs", "'", "is", "a", "call", "to", "action", "to", "shift", "the", "focus", "away", "from", "the", "financial", "aspect", "of", "climate", "action", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", "provided", "suggest", "that", "costs", "can", "be", "a", "significant", "barrier", "to", "taking", "action", ",", "and", "that", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "costs", "is", "a", "common", "sentiment", ".", "However", ",", "the", "text", "also", "emphas", "izes", "the", "numerous", "benefits", "of", "climate", "action", ",", "which", "can", "out", "we", "igh", "the", "costs", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "classification", "of", "'", "stop", "focusing", "on", "costs", "'", "as", "a", "positive", "statement", "is", "based", "on", "the", "idea", "that", "by", "shifting", "the", "focus", "away", "from", "costs", ",", "more", "people", "may", "be", "encouraged", "to", "take", "action", "due", "to", "the", "recognition", "of", "the", "benefits", ".", "This", "is", "in", "line", "with", "the", "sentiment", "of", "the", "background", "sentence", "'", "we", "need", "to", "stop", "focusing", "on", "costs", "and", "talk", "instead", "about", "the", "huge", "no", "of", "co", "benefits", "of", "climate", "action", "'.", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9336574077606201, 0.6308368444442749, 0.7368493676185608, 0.9998518824577332, 0.8153707385063171, 0.9994258880615234, 0.9999816417694092, 0.9999979138374329, 0.9999955296516418, 0.9997818470001221, 0.3720303773880005, 0.7442010045051575, 0.8806546926498413, 0.9082638621330261, 0.896415114402771, 0.35637471079826355, 0.6439110040664673, 0.5669644474983215, 0.36586394906044006, 0.6675896644592285, 0.9999600648880005, 0.6365691423416138, 0.6159406900405884, 0.4210703670978546, 0.6725231409072876, 0.768038272857666, 0.968425452709198, 0.47995781898498535, 0.279758483171463, 0.5011187791824341, 0.9515162110328674, 0.4741312861442566, 0.9457235336303711, 0.29376503825187683, 0.287921667098999, 0.9524307250976562, 0.17736540734767914, 0.4555244445800781, 0.8963364958763123, 0.9763807654380798, 0.5290282368659973, 0.8602477312088013, 0.9095963835716248, 0.5391342639923096, 0.7494712471961975, 0.2703239321708679, 0.25068822503089905, 0.29170963168144226, 0.23194730281829834, 0.5669639706611633, 0.875716507434845, 0.6674591302871704, 0.32373854517936707, 0.6397795677185059, 0.26436612010002136, 0.8590605854988098, 0.3521280586719513, 0.860905647277832, 0.9467373490333557, 0.9999804496765137, 0.8229526281356812, 0.4438759684562683, 0.47035449743270874, 0.2798583507537842, 0.9991753101348877, 0.9736510515213013, 0.8323575854301453, 0.8394231200218201, 0.7963235974311829, 0.9446282982826233, 0.9998463988304138, 0.6300318837165833, 0.37682440876960754, 0.34159234166145325, 0.7974942326545715, 0.9999822378158569, 0.9999974966049194, 0.9514604210853577, 0.9717056155204773, 0.960780918598175, 0.4476364552974701, 0.9999828934669495, 0.625131368637085, 0.15637697279453278, 0.7845824360847473, 0.4621289074420929, 0.9985893368721008, 0.9999709129333496, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9999935626983643, 0.9999966025352478, 0.9886889457702637, 0.36297208070755005, 0.7878291010856628, 0.5227348208427429, 0.6140187978744507, 0.7957029938697815, 0.9999847412109375, 0.9925536513328552, 0.35138431191444397, 0.997228741645813, 0.5076237320899963, 0.382781445980072, 0.7598690390586853, 0.9971237182617188, 0.8287053108215332, 0.9999887943267822, 0.9060637950897217, 0.8482334017753601, 0.548947811126709, 0.9665853977203369, 0.9008961319923401, 0.9968944787979126, 0.6201848983764648, 0.9644024968147278, 0.9786954522132874, 0.8733460307121277, 0.3012416660785675, 0.9999725818634033, 0.9532433152198792, 0.2866726517677307, 0.9744522571563721, 0.9875795841217041, 0.521052896976471, 0.7452039122581482, 0.44314703345298767, 0.21219322085380554, 0.4032702147960663, 0.9218687415122986, 0.9999935626983643, 0.931175708770752, 0.6379793882369995, 0.8253148198127747, 0.8560227155685425, 0.36062905192375183, 0.4447998106479645, 0.6740480661392212, 0.9621773362159729, 0.999996542930603, 0.9999999403953552, 0.6972494125366211, 0.999941885471344, 0.9999983906745911, 0.9999969005584717, 0.9953514337539673, 0.9999895095825195, 0.9998730421066284, 0.999987006187439, 0.9999791979789734, 0.9997786283493042, 0.532425045967102, 0.9979076981544495, 0.9991074800491333, 0.9333464503288269, 0.9993852376937866, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9999855756759644, 0.6882013082504272, 0.19606180489063263]}

Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase 'claims' in this context is negative.\n\nExplanation:\nThe text expresses that astronomers are facing issues with SpaceX satellites due to their brightness, making it difficult for them to observe objects farther away in space. The word 'claims' in this context refers to SpaceX's statement that they have used darker solar panels to address this issue. However, the negative sentiment in the text suggests that this solution may not be effective, and the problems persist. Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase 'claims' is negative, as it is associated with the difficulties and challenges that astronomers are experiencing with SpaceX's satellites",

In this context, the text suggests that rapid progress towards low carbon transitions cannot be made without considering social justice.

For example, the negative sentiment associated with the phrase 'at the expense' is consistent with the negative sentiment expressed in the background knowledge about the threats posed by climate change and the potential negative consequences of sacrificing social justice in the pursuit of progress. Similarly, the negative examples provided illustrate the potential for loss or sacrifice when considering the impact of various actions or policies.

The negative sentiment of the first background sentence does not affect the polarity determination of the target phrase.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "ben", "ef", "it", "'", "is", "classified", "as", "positive", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", "suggest", "that", "while", "climate", "change", "presents", "challenges", ",", "it", "also", "offers", "opportunities", ".", "The", "phrase", "'", "ear", "ly", "investors", "in", "clean", "energy", "stand", "to", "benefit", "'", "indicates", "that", "there", "is", "a", "potential", "gain", "from", "investing", "in", "clean", "energy", ",", "which", "align", "s", "with", "the", "positive", "sentiment", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", ".", "The", "phrase", "'", "enable", "investment", "in", "clean", "energy", "production", "'", "further", "rein", "for", "ces", "this", "idea", ",", "as", "it", "suggests", "that", "investing", "in", "clean", "energy", "is", "a", "means", "of", "making", "a", "positive", "impact", "and", "potentially", "gaining", "a", "financial", "benefit", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "of", "the", "first", "background", "sentence", "does", "not", "affect", "the", "pol", "arity", "determination", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9811616539955139, 0.6257950067520142, 0.6703943610191345, 0.97027188539505, 0.8857513666152954, 0.9999828934669495, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9976904392242432, 0.366350919008255, 0.6619165539741516, 0.9999313950538635, 0.5872257351875305, 0.8204078078269958, 0.5336217880249023, 0.2918666899204254, 0.7253205180168152, 0.6753517985343933, 0.9082692861557007, 0.32409214973449707, 0.9392051100730896, 0.15587493777275085, 0.5295774340629578, 0.9999727010726929, 0.4535055458545685, 0.5237935781478882, 0.8896137475967407, 0.7004349231719971, 0.9556825160980225, 0.6686322689056396, 0.9989625215530396, 0.47706338763237, 0.3636668026447296, 0.2882518172264099, 0.9900292754173279, 0.9365917444229126, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9998639225959778, 0.9963363409042358, 0.9999783039093018, 0.9995818734169006, 0.944537341594696, 0.999996542930603, 0.9999786615371704, 0.9987661838531494, 0.19798195362091064, 0.8047081828117371, 0.3417817950248718, 0.6074976921081543, 0.462898313999176, 0.7475895285606384, 0.7192971706390381, 0.3502916991710663, 0.5725159049034119, 0.9980937242507935, 0.9219610691070557, 0.9973099827766418, 0.34348776936531067, 0.3960514962673187, 0.6706435680389404, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9990829229354858, 0.9364944696426392, 0.9059873223304749, 0.947196900844574, 0.3507503271102905, 0.9580255150794983, 0.8635199666023254, 0.9996479749679565, 0.795365035533905, 0.3229547142982483, 0.17446379363536835, 0.9288952946662903, 0.30053025484085083, 0.9999112486839294, 0.9906883239746094, 0.9999747276306152, 0.6266590356826782, 0.9689341187477112, 0.9901475310325623, 0.6492458581924438, 0.4110986888408661, 0.9999951124191284, 0.9999999403953552, 0.7296835780143738, 0.3408363163471222, 0.42970865964889526, 0.6423852443695068, 0.7965701222419739, 0.4497559070587158, 0.6358098983764648, 0.23564447462558746, 0.9990268349647522, 0.9652905464172363, 0.9998056888580322, 0.3619285225868225, 0.8659346103668213, 0.22459100186824799, 0.5853246450424194, 0.5631853938102722, 0.9928955435752869, 0.9674975275993347, 0.7449220418930054, 0.5396316051483154, 0.5399274826049805, 0.38069969415664673, 0.7993085980415344, 0.5407770276069641, 0.43596151471138, 0.9890068173408508, 0.31064921617507935, 0.4347262978553772, 0.9387254118919373, 0.3148724138736725, 0.8777912259101868, 0.7130590677261353, 0.9685549736022949, 0.9801536202430725, 0.5357986092567444, 0.9999405145645142, 0.3437958359718323, 0.9992696046829224, 0.4675295948982239, 0.999999463558197, 0.5166577696800232, 0.46506768465042114, 0.9952143430709839, 0.9996539950370789, 0.9998396039009094, 0.47376367449760437, 0.8382630944252014]}
