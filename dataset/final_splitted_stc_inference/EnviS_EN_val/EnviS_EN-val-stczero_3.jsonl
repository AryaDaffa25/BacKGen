However, the target phrase focuses on the negative perception, making the polarity classification negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "The", "phrase", "'", "in", "cre", "ase", "in", "cost", "is", "often", "seen", "as", "a", "road", "block", "'", "implies", "that", "an", "increase", "in", "cost", "is", "perceived", "as", "an", "obst", "acle", "or", "hind", "r", "ance", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "pol", "arity", "of", "this", "phrase", "is", "negative", ".", "The", "text", "also", "ment", "ions", "that", "some", "firms", "report", "no", "change", "or", "even", "a", "decrease", "in", "costs", "due", "to", "sustainable", "product", "design", ",", "which", "contrad", "icts", "the", "negative", "perception", "of", "an", "increase", "in", "cost", ".", "However", ",", "the", "target", "phrase", "focuses", "on", "the", "negative", "perception", ",", "making", "the", "pol", "arity", "classification", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.39392343163490295, 0.999993085861206, 0.8250547647476196, 0.6281650066375732, 0.991133987903595, 0.9999690055847168, 0.9999709129333496, 0.9977582097053528, 0.4830991327762604, 0.4863777756690979, 0.7318146228790283, 0.9275273084640503, 0.9999754428863525, 0.9999089241027832, 0.9999984502792358, 0.9999858140945435, 0.9905831813812256, 0.9999830722808838, 0.9999393224716187, 0.9998853206634521, 0.9997530579566956, 0.9999765157699585, 0.9999964237213135, 0.9996527433395386, 0.3173004686832428, 0.8585704565048218, 0.62997967004776, 0.9905485510826111, 0.999922513961792, 0.9951500296592712, 0.8881815075874329, 0.3210839629173279, 0.8534003496170044, 0.643648087978363, 0.9908208250999451, 0.9994565844535828, 0.9338043332099915, 0.5554207563400269, 0.9999889135360718, 0.9999730587005615, 0.3341154158115387, 0.4208437502384186, 0.9995285272598267, 0.5269360542297363, 0.8128966093063354, 0.9999994039535522, 0.8624963164329529, 0.9256753325462341, 0.7833523154258728, 0.9905470013618469, 0.8629457950592041, 0.5997803211212158, 0.36514097452163696, 0.4825562834739685, 0.4694637060165405, 0.7074922323226929, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9427343010902405, 0.8906448483467102, 0.9806023836135864, 0.7394747138023376, 0.8693674206733704, 0.9996497631072998, 0.947892963886261, 0.9767018556594849, 0.9989870190620422, 0.9992801547050476, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9996753931045532, 0.7182294130325317, 0.9999988079071045, 0.9998886585235596, 0.9994242191314697, 0.9999850988388062, 0.9090271592140198, 0.8576675057411194, 0.32249608635902405, 0.9998506307601929, 0.9994316697120667, 0.470271497964859, 0.6174235343933105, 0.6016672253608704, 0.8290218114852905, 0.9903143048286438, 0.9999920129776001, 0.9871484637260437, 0.478695273399353, 0.4605031907558441, 0.9999970197677612, 0.946466863155365, 0.3030976355075836, 0.9998059868812561, 0.3489409387111664, 0.9432679414749146, 0.9991023540496826, 0.4957840144634247, 0.7644248604774475, 0.39173275232315063, 0.5029142498970032, 0.583806037902832, 0.5987514853477478, 0.9999983310699463, 0.7427348494529724, 0.6684930920600891, 0.9950172305107117, 0.9785826206207275]}

Therefore, while the target phrase itself is neutral, the overall sentiment of the text is likely to be positive.\n\nExplanation:\nThe text describes how Tesco has removed cardboard box packaging from major toothpaste brands such as Oral-B and Colgate. While the target phrase 'removed cardboard box' is a neutral statement, the context of the text suggests that this removal is likely to have a positive impact on the environment. Cardboard packaging is often less recyclable and more resource-intensive to produce than alternative materials, such as plastic or aluminum. By removing cardboard packaging, Tesco is likely reducing the amount of waste generated and making the production process more efficient. Therefore, while the target phrase itself is neutral, the overall sentiment of the text is likely to be positive.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "removed", "card",

The speaker is suggesting that we should shift our attention away from the costs associated with taking climate action. This implies that the current focus on costs is a hindrance or a problem, and that by changing our focus, we can make progress towards reducing our carbon footprint. Therefore, the instruction to 'stop focusing on costs' is a call to action that aims to overcome a perceived obstacle, and it carries a negative connotation.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "stop", "focusing", "on", "costs", "'", "is", "a", "negative", "instruction", ".", "The", "speaker", "is", "suggesting", "that", "we", "should", "shift", "our", "attention", "away", "from", "the", "costs", "associated", "with", "taking", "climate", "action", ".", "This", "implies", "that", "the", "current", "focus", "on", "costs", "is", "a", "hind", "r", "ance", "or", "a", "problem", ",", "and", "that", "by", "changing", "our", "focus", ",", "we", "can", "make", "progress", "towards", "reducing", "our", "carbon", "foot", "print", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "instruction", "to", "'", "stop", "focusing", "on", "costs", "'", "is", "a", "call", "to", "action", "that", "aims", "to", "overcome", "a", "perceived", "obst", "acle", ",", "and", "it", "carries", "a", "negative", "con", "notation", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.932488739490509, 0.3742293417453766, 0.4576156735420227, 0.999841570854187, 0.6812151074409485, 0.9990392923355103, 0.9999836683273315, 0.9999938011169434, 0.9999868869781494, 0.9995922446250916, 0.281228631734848, 0.6459311842918396, 0.63751620054245, 0.45198386907577515, 0.5333624482154846, 0.4756617248058319, 0.23047712445259094, 0.688240647315979, 0.7151151895523071, 0.9408047199249268, 0.592924952507019, 0.8608492016792297, 0.332003653049469, 0.9924154281616211, 0.8085477948188782, 0.9881390929222107, 0.9998279809951782, 0.4857023060321808, 0.499420702457428, 0.630006730556488, 0.9999884366989136, 0.5062967538833618, 0.7786194682121277, 0.9867768883705139, 0.5317264795303345, 0.6257519125938416, 0.6945932507514954, 0.8931066989898682, 0.565764307975769, 0.7849152088165283, 0.9311617612838745, 0.9960649609565735, 0.9947826266288757, 0.9714539647102356, 0.25223076343536377, 0.5960545539855957, 0.999601423740387, 0.999995231628418, 0.542140543460846, 0.7094711661338806, 0.4594131112098694, 0.4993323087692261, 0.5935026407241821, 0.5646578669548035, 0.5677213668823242, 0.41218701004981995, 0.9451742768287659, 0.9429552555084229, 0.9685662388801575, 0.999748170375824, 0.6610971093177795, 0.835811197757721, 0.9960342049598694, 0.40851399302482605, 0.7851385474205017, 0.9744505286216736, 0.9997866749763489, 0.9998351335525513, 0.9999730587005615, 0.8871246576309204, 0.26154643297195435, 0.9999011754989624, 0.9681704044342041, 0.6338592767715454, 0.8307985663414001, 0.9836439490318298, 0.9999732971191406, 0.9994656443595886, 0.9998425245285034, 0.9999982118606567, 0.9999920129776001, 0.5227813124656677, 0.4855356514453888, 0.542437732219696, 0.9560168385505676, 0.9382091760635376, 0.6664786338806152, 0.4160831868648529, 0.9999768733978271, 0.4663415253162384, 0.7136558294296265, 0.8217065334320068, 0.5793970227241516, 0.9999978542327881, 0.4869309663772583, 0.4130989611148834, 0.541578471660614, 0.48562654852867126, 0.9999386072158813, 0.9991133809089661, 0.7274764776229858, 0.9999775886535645, 0.9242631793022156, 0.5566187500953674]}
