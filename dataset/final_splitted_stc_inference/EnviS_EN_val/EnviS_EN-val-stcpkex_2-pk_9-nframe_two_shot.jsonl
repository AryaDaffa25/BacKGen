In this case, the neutral sentiment subjectivity of the sentiment phrase does not contradict the positive sentiment of the text.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "no", "change", "in", "costs", "\"", "is", "neutral", ".", "The", "reason", "is", "that", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "itself", "does", "not", "convey", "any", "positive", "or", "negative", "emotion", ",", "as", "it", "simply", "states", "a", "fact", ".", "The", "text", "as", "a", "whole", ",", "however", ",", "le", "ans", "towards", "a", "positive", "sentiment", ",", "as", "it", "challenges", "the", "common", "stere", "otype", "that", "sustainable", "product", "design", "always", "leads", "to", "increased", "costs", "and", "highlights", "the", "cases", "where", "it", "actually", "leads", "to", "cost", "savings", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "should", "be", "evaluated", "in", "the", "context", "of", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "the", "neutral", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "does", "not", "contrad", "ict", "the", "positive", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9651238322257996, 0.8434187173843384, 0.977416455745697, 0.5127086639404297, 0.9999749064445496, 0.7062346935272217, 0.9744374752044678, 0.5551950931549072, 0.999813973903656, 0.6106259226799011, 0.9996383786201477, 0.9999943971633911, 0.999988853931427, 0.9999231696128845, 0.9996110796928406, 0.6910965442657471, 0.5459088087081909, 0.7225592732429504, 0.4115521311759949, 0.6231788396835327, 0.6007452011108398, 0.9460175037384033, 0.7848739624023438, 0.3817058801651001, 0.9953910112380981, 0.7861111760139465, 0.7312172055244446, 0.9996952414512634, 0.3840390741825104, 0.4821774959564209, 0.7849157452583313, 0.9998222589492798, 0.999940812587738, 0.5395760536193848, 0.3823682963848114, 0.35932621359825134, 0.9641268253326416, 0.5482072234153748, 0.6251755356788635, 0.9775135517120361, 0.9996809363365173, 0.7518885135650635, 0.7699393033981323, 0.24728409945964813, 0.4268918037414551, 0.99995356798172, 0.9999907612800598, 0.41813844442367554, 0.725820779800415, 0.9999992251396179, 0.4176957309246063, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9144623875617981, 0.6208224892616272, 0.9995114803314209, 0.9953452944755554, 0.3844820559024811, 0.890018880367279, 0.9991682767868042, 0.46579912304878235, 0.9975656867027283, 0.514509916305542, 0.3029576539993286, 0.9999920725822449, 0.9911792874336243, 0.9342661499977112, 0.9898678064346313, 0.9996045827865601, 0.7985854148864746, 0.5177455544471741, 0.9999999403953552, 0.7607515454292297, 0.9999825358390808, 0.3853345513343811, 0.4423874616622925, 0.8544923663139343, 0.22568322718143463, 0.7858833074569702, 0.7084305286407471, 0.4553695023059845, 0.5324541330337524, 0.9999996423721313, 0.6793928742408752, 0.9723581075668335, 0.9240904450416565, 0.7093974351882935, 0.9999812841415405, 0.8484346270561218, 0.5584779381752014, 0.573643684387207, 0.9999968409538269, 0.7958879470825195, 0.9829548001289368, 0.6481710076332092, 0.9995867609977722, 0.9159368276596069, 0.539920449256897, 0.7422787547111511, 0.5147839188575745, 0.9804816842079163, 0.9937785267829895, 0.9999982118606567, 0.999768853187561, 0.8816398978233337, 0.591354489326477, 0.9971127510070801, 0.9999996423721313, 0.999906063079834, 0.6662076711654663, 0.4253076910972595, 0.9377245903015137, 0.9088338613510132, 0.999999463558197, 0.7959949970245361, 0.7375941276550293, 0.9976051449775696, 0.8480557203292847, 0.9999909400939941, 0.9274125695228577, 0.9457362294197083, 0.9061838984489441, 0.9998740553855896, 0.734518826007843, 0.9999920725822449, 0.4408540427684784, 0.999997079372406, 0.647097110748291, 0.8810515403747559, 0.986144483089447, 0.9988591074943542, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9997149705886841, 0.39719441533088684, 0.8406112194061279]}

The negative sentiment subjectivity is consistent with the overall negative sentiment of the text, which expresses frustration and disappointment with the lack of prioritization of public improvements and the focus on tax cuts for the wealthy.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "sh", "ocked", "'", "is", "negative", ".", "The", "person", "was", "shocked", "in", "a", "disappointed", "or", "dis", "may", "ed", "way", ",", "likely", "due", "to", "the", "unexpected", "ly", "poor", "condition", "of", "the", "public", "rest", "rooms", "they", "encountered", ".", "This", "negative", "experience", "is", "in", "contrast", "to", "the", "positive", "experiences", "they", "had", "with", "clean", "and", "updated", "environments", "in", "other", "places", ",", "which", "may", "have", "been", "influenced", "by", "political", "factors", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "does", "not", "directly", "refer", "to", "any", "specific", "political", "issue", ",", "but", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", "suggests", "that", "the", "person", "may", "have", "had", "expectations", "for", "public", "improvements", "based", "on", "their", "experiences", "in", "other", "places", ",", "which", "were", "not", "met", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "is", "consistent", "with", "the", "overall", "negative", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", ",", "which", "express", "es", "frustration", "and", "disappointment", "with", "the", "lack", "of", "prior", "it", "ization", "of", "public", "improvements", "and", "the", "focus", "on", "tax", "cuts", "for", "the", "wealthy", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8678480982780457, 0.7301750183105469, 0.9955272674560547, 0.6533395051956177, 0.999986469745636, 0.6275580525398254, 0.9580469727516174, 0.7174792289733887, 0.9998039603233337, 0.7537538409233093, 0.9999626874923706, 0.9998840689659119, 0.999064028263092, 0.49151411652565, 0.9346541166305542, 0.37131813168525696, 0.7840253710746765, 0.2751381993293762, 0.4389948546886444, 0.7871127724647522, 0.6223957538604736, 0.9962679147720337, 0.2613125741481781, 0.7677158713340759, 0.6272770762443542, 0.6358680725097656, 0.9999851584434509, 0.8008999228477478, 0.38124996423721313, 0.32248345017433167, 0.8807697892189026, 0.9999437928199768, 0.6431210041046143, 0.6667436361312866, 0.5966041088104248, 0.8168008327484131, 0.9689724445343018, 0.9985843896865845, 0.9981839656829834, 0.9290130138397217, 0.9999186396598816, 0.999636709690094, 0.523574948310852, 0.9646766781806946, 0.6595202088356018, 0.5193979144096375, 0.36695581674575806, 0.28787603974342346, 0.29020360112190247, 0.5347326993942261, 0.9590345621109009, 0.9915035367012024, 0.6006125807762146, 0.46528759598731995, 0.3558526933193207, 0.5156418681144714, 0.4672786295413971, 0.5205802321434021, 0.8755993843078613, 0.7771275043487549, 0.9965472221374512, 0.39025774598121643, 0.772115170955658, 0.9323437809944153, 0.8550167679786682, 0.7103900909423828, 0.4873259961605072, 0.22625026106834412, 0.6211221218109131, 0.8041723370552063, 0.629639208316803, 0.9999757409095764, 0.684714674949646, 0.6574494242668152, 0.5319361090660095, 0.5198026895523071, 0.6124550104141235, 0.5685122013092041, 0.44226428866386414, 0.9999822974205017, 0.24819879233837128, 0.3697664439678192, 0.9999973773956299, 0.7748581171035767, 0.6662976741790771, 0.28106650710105896, 0.18624930083751678, 0.5074189901351929, 0.9980934262275696, 0.9631057381629944, 0.3615073263645172, 0.4814280569553375, 0.9997386336326599, 0.9873596429824829, 0.5857431888580322, 0.7116386890411377, 0.8715670108795166, 0.6528338193893433, 0.5011041164398193, 0.3753904104232788, 0.6495101451873779, 0.3017757833003998, 0.48150476813316345, 0.5860602259635925, 0.9956698417663574, 0.75178062915802, 0.9999976754188538, 0.6002108454704285, 0.7634817957878113, 0.6747198104858398, 0.968414306640625, 0.5863742828369141, 0.6723406910896301, 0.5994349122047424, 0.9992010593414307, 0.9897540807723999, 0.9998912811279297, 0.6829607486724854, 0.6051115393638611, 0.2582818269729614, 0.9973524212837219, 0.8587796092033386, 0.9999944567680359, 0.799030065536499, 0.6395846009254456, 0.9999808073043823, 0.9869771599769592, 0.7612770199775696, 0.7454133033752441, 0.9876583218574524, 0.6034256219863892, 0.9999870657920837, 0.9992966055870056, 0.863755464553833, 0.9928811192512512, 0.7538861036300659, 0.9999733567237854, 0.87812739610672, 0.9635076522827148, 0.9025726914405823, 0.9900835752487183, 0.9555830359458923, 0.859048068523407, 0.9999862313270569, 0.962710976600647, 0.9999962449073792, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9909067153930664, 0.9327278733253479, 0.9995693564414978, 0.9724767208099365, 0.9989034533500671, 0.6518166661262512, 0.9998907446861267, 0.9988667368888855, 0.999993622303009, 0.9999351501464844, 0.9987740516662598, 0.9999414086341858, 0.7317295670509338, 0.9413968920707703]}

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity of the sentiment phrase 'nongmo' is positive, as it is consistent with the overall positive sentiment of the text.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "n", "ong", "mo", "'", "is", "positive", ".", "The", "reason", "is", "that", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "n", "ong", "mo", "'", "is", "often", "associated", "with", "the", "production", "of", "food", "that", "is", "free", "from", "gen", "et", "ically", "modified", "organ", "isms", "(", "G", "MO", "s", "),", "which", "is", "generally", "considered", "to", "be", "a", "health", "ier", "and", "more", "sustainable", "choice", ".", "In", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", ",", "the", "use", "of", "the", "term", "'", "n", "ong", "mo", "'", "is", "likely", "to", "be", "seen", "as", "a", "positive", "attribute", ",", "as", "the", "text", "emphas", "izes", "the", "health", "benefits", "and", "sustain", "ability", "of", "the", "coffee", "and", "m", "ues", "li", ",", "which", "are", "also", "described", "as", "being", "free", "from", "artificial", "flav", "ors", "and", "colors", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "n", "ong", "mo", "'", "is", "positive", ",", "as", "it", "is", "consistent", "with", "the", "overall", "positive", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8789137005805969, 0.7816181778907776, 0.9534898996353149, 0.8179684281349182, 0.9999464750289917, 0.5897180438041687, 0.9663002490997314, 0.7115606069564819, 0.9998161196708679, 0.8042091727256775, 0.9997296929359436, 0.9999934434890747, 0.9999896287918091, 0.999323844909668, 0.8894508481025696, 0.5847922563552856, 0.7003355622291565, 0.48775312304496765, 0.2565028965473175, 0.8072332739830017, 0.9431866407394409, 0.4085683226585388, 0.24477757513523102, 0.9949228167533875, 0.4166133999824524, 0.9998948574066162, 0.9998595118522644, 0.9999412298202515, 0.9953293204307556, 0.2582279443740845, 0.33635756373405457, 0.9664668440818787, 0.9999664425849915, 0.2999160885810852, 0.37964528799057007, 0.5719829797744751, 0.6148133277893066, 0.6321063041687012, 0.99387127161026, 0.8402671813964844, 0.9822371602058411, 0.9523723721504211, 0.9999905228614807, 0.9999943971633911, 0.9995349645614624, 0.9999405741691589, 0.9999814033508301, 0.6601892709732056, 0.9999786019325256, 0.9999839663505554, 0.9960466623306274, 0.876093327999115, 0.9771044850349426, 0.8720247745513916, 0.2543068528175354, 0.40273138880729675, 0.6149163842201233, 0.9997777342796326, 0.5236145257949829, 0.6186875700950623, 0.9999942183494568, 0.9977703094482422, 0.9972431063652039, 0.7731353044509888, 0.811757504940033, 0.41629427671432495, 0.29177895188331604, 0.7163885831832886, 0.5954725742340088, 0.9891570806503296, 0.9989808201789856, 0.7211143970489502, 0.8362500071525574, 0.7015643119812012, 0.24564343690872192, 0.9999997019767761, 0.7257816195487976, 0.5961196422576904, 0.9996410012245178, 0.9938353896141052, 0.9999868869781494, 0.9999962449073792, 0.9999681711196899, 0.27986618876457214, 0.7421192526817322, 0.7213438749313354, 0.9553854465484619, 0.48360589146614075, 0.99969482421875, 0.9750704765319824, 0.8564392328262329, 0.5317679047584534, 0.7084168791770935, 0.8220621347427368, 0.7278210520744324, 0.9167726635932922, 0.44818955659866333, 0.9974216818809509, 0.995263397693634, 0.972563624382019, 0.972488284111023, 0.823572039604187, 0.6108487248420715, 0.9999861717224121, 0.9978513121604919, 0.9813714623451233, 0.860601544380188, 0.9973233938217163, 0.9441954493522644, 0.9999935626983643, 0.9999961853027344, 0.34005582332611084, 0.47131481766700745, 0.761476993560791, 0.4750857949256897, 0.8422965407371521, 0.9999960064888, 0.6845384240150452, 0.843355119228363, 0.9958558082580566, 0.9926897287368774, 0.9807591438293457, 0.8095954060554504, 0.5477375984191895, 0.9977924227714539, 0.8415423035621643, 0.6463735699653625, 0.9999955892562866, 0.993238627910614, 0.9940241575241089, 0.6885839104652405, 0.9999977350234985, 0.6211795210838318, 0.6135355234146118, 0.9238430857658386, 0.999915599822998, 0.9943592548370361, 0.9999983906745911, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9999982118606567, 0.9997638463973999, 0.8522964119911194, 0.9215341806411743, 0.5303044319152832, 0.9647284150123596, 0.9996607303619385, 0.6963337659835815, 0.7315323352813721, 0.999995768070221, 0.9999377727508545, 0.8906207084655762, 0.8858869075775146, 0.8378986716270447, 0.887811005115509, 0.999999463558197, 0.9998770952224731, 0.960046112537384, 0.9747055768966675]}

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity for the sentiment phrase 'a gmo' is negative, as it reflects the negative sentiment towards GMOs expressed in the text.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "a", "g", "mo", "'", "is", "negative", ".", "The", "reason", "is", "that", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "a", "g", "mo", "'", "is", "associated", "with", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "gen", "et", "ically", "modified", "organ", "isms", "(", "G", "MO", "s", ")", "in", "the", "text", ",", "which", "is", "expressed", "through", "the", "sentiment", "phrases", "'", "most", "people", "wouldn", "'", "t", "eat", "a", "g", "mo", "'", "and", "'", "why", "would", "they", "inject", "a", "g", "mo", "'.", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "G", "MO", "s", "is", "a", "common", "stere", "otype", "in", "the", "context", "of", "discussions", "about", "food", "systems", "and", "health", ",", "and", "it", "is", "often", "linked", "to", "concerns", "about", "the", "potential", "risks", "and", "negative", "impacts", "of", "these", "organ", "isms", "on", "human", "health", "and", "the", "environment", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "a", "g", "mo", "'", "is", "negative", ",", "as", "it", "reflects", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "G", "MO", "s", "expressed", "in", "the", "text", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.905464768409729, 0.6290602684020996, 0.9663287997245789, 0.7475405931472778, 0.9999577403068542, 0.7861394882202148, 0.9432454705238342, 0.6605948209762573, 0.999847412109375, 0.5041638016700745, 0.9984936714172363, 0.6933307647705078, 0.9998419284820557, 0.9996400475502014, 0.7172119617462158, 0.9623313546180725, 0.4795415997505188, 0.4857749044895172, 0.24632705748081207, 0.8448927998542786, 0.9691449999809265, 0.6423388123512268, 0.2443908005952835, 0.9714639782905579, 0.7251565456390381, 0.9862176775932312, 0.9938180446624756, 0.9970170855522156, 0.9984747767448425, 0.837131679058075, 0.37329158186912537, 0.9989942908287048, 0.5573186278343201, 0.8849356770515442, 0.8818864822387695, 0.7571623921394348, 0.8836245536804199, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9998388290405273, 0.9998574256896973, 0.9999564290046692, 0.26958516240119934, 0.9992583394050598, 0.9999828934669495, 0.9973486065864563, 0.9458120465278625, 0.4486469328403473, 0.9970517754554749, 0.6068403124809265, 0.6201627850532532, 0.47912323474884033, 0.3602420687675476, 0.42415371537208557, 0.732235312461853, 0.45663270354270935, 0.506588876247406, 0.7117905020713806, 0.8727001547813416, 0.3718494176864624, 0.999998152256012, 0.9988366365432739, 0.7902712821960449, 0.9999596476554871, 0.999994695186615, 0.999989926815033, 0.7032812237739563, 0.999993622303009, 0.9930564165115356, 0.9999920725822449, 0.9999196529388428, 0.9083840250968933, 0.9999942779541016, 0.9999922513961792, 0.9987004995346069, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9999118447303772, 0.9999909400939941, 0.5547420382499695, 0.4896039068698883, 0.6623426079750061, 0.9888446927070618, 0.9156950116157532, 0.9998717308044434, 0.9999986290931702, 0.9999983310699463, 0.6320542693138123, 0.3078673481941223, 0.9366912245750427, 0.5809001922607422, 0.9999786615371704, 0.40977421402931213, 0.5617860555648804, 0.8499785661697388, 0.994597852230072, 0.4149321913719177, 0.9307188987731934, 0.6173033118247986, 0.7818427681922913, 0.8876193761825562, 0.27708956599235535, 0.7224128246307373, 0.49794310331344604, 0.4954611659049988, 0.9252084493637085, 0.8039604425430298, 0.819883406162262, 0.9959385395050049, 0.9781306385993958, 0.9826224446296692, 0.5563779473304749, 0.9020859599113464, 0.6484416723251343, 0.9853334426879883, 0.9392610788345337, 0.7716900110244751, 0.9439888596534729, 0.6443092226982117, 0.9469536542892456, 0.9999989867210388, 0.884247899055481, 0.7303627729415894, 0.9990109205245972, 0.9944838285446167, 0.9999203085899353, 0.9999337792396545, 0.9954251050949097, 0.5244854688644409, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9704931378364563, 0.9842025637626648, 0.5067449808120728, 0.9999974966049194, 0.7637720704078674, 0.9232933521270752, 0.9763056635856628, 0.9999308586120605, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9999949336051941, 0.9997130632400513, 0.9999588131904602, 0.9999870657920837, 0.9019765257835388, 0.9902175664901733, 0.39348340034484863, 0.5813484787940979, 0.9966164827346802, 0.3882681727409363, 0.9278188347816467, 0.6783114075660706, 0.9739251732826233, 0.7877194285392761, 0.9257570505142212, 0.9999996423721313, 1.0, 0.5011442303657532, 0.9951626658439636, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9975898265838623, 0.9996718764305115, 0.9692891240119934]}

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity for the phrase 'unforeseen changes' is negative, as it fits with the overall negative sentiment of the text.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "un", "fore", "seen", "changes", "'", "is", "negative", ".", "The", "reason", "is", "that", "the", "phrase", "'", "un", "fore", "seen", "changes", "'", "is", "often", "associated", "with", "negative", "consequences", ",", "as", "it", "implies", "unexpected", "and", "potentially", "harmful", "events", "or", "outcomes", ".", "The", "text", "itself", "also", "has", "a", "negative", "sentiment", ",", "as", "it", "discuss", "es", "the", "potential", "damage", "that", "G", "MO", "organ", "isms", "can", "cause", "to", "the", "local", "ec", "ology", "and", "the", "environment", ",", "and", "the", "importance", "of", "raising", "awareness", "about", "this", "issue", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "phrase", "'", "un", "fore", "seen", "changes", "'", "is", "negative", ",", "as", "it", "fits", "with", "the", "overall", "negative", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8030701875686646, 0.7234675288200378, 0.9742186665534973, 0.6433145999908447, 0.9999859929084778, 0.643242359161377, 0.9825985431671143, 0.5816290974617004, 0.9997684955596924, 0.5388391613960266, 0.9999874830245972, 0.9999878406524658, 0.9999929070472717, 0.999986469745636, 0.9997453093528748, 0.576795220375061, 0.9750478863716125, 0.47452312707901, 0.5911922454833984, 0.6333892941474915, 0.7797641754150391, 0.9841309785842896, 0.9076741933822632, 0.4720395505428314, 0.46717047691345215, 0.9990385174751282, 0.9999794363975525, 0.999991238117218, 0.9996939301490784, 0.9999256134033203, 0.4158293902873993, 0.6659687161445618, 0.9145799875259399, 0.9999799132347107, 0.4261511564254761, 0.5429547429084778, 0.40204912424087524, 0.3033881187438965, 0.45175984501838684, 0.8343408107757568, 0.4616113603115082, 0.6488245129585266, 0.7878891229629517, 0.7433781027793884, 0.3996412754058838, 0.40266740322113037, 0.373761385679245, 0.8107439279556274, 0.4680124521255493, 0.6032103896141052, 0.3036837577819824, 0.6814644932746887, 0.27235162258148193, 0.9985259771347046, 0.8562260866165161, 0.9963582754135132, 0.7559360861778259, 0.3960861265659332, 0.9996581077575684, 0.3724954426288605, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9923029541969299, 0.9260861277580261, 0.5639160871505737, 0.34250351786613464, 0.5918378233909607, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9921186566352844, 0.9999855756759644, 0.9945979714393616, 0.8998622894287109, 0.9996293187141418, 0.874318540096283, 0.9534558653831482, 0.9999234676361084, 0.9999995231628418, 0.7966980338096619, 0.797003984451294, 0.8029142022132874, 0.7100162506103516, 0.6026237607002258, 0.7495403289794922, 0.5236936211585999, 0.9999996423721313, 0.5350396633148193, 0.9999547004699707, 0.7865195274353027, 0.6537652611732483, 0.9995154142379761, 0.9852540493011475, 0.6179050207138062, 0.999995231628418, 0.7444835305213928, 0.8098260760307312, 0.9097006320953369, 0.9999966025352478, 0.7321737408638, 0.8795067071914673, 0.5650619268417358, 0.9971352815628052, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9999744296073914, 0.9999817609786987, 0.9999909996986389, 0.9997370839118958, 0.7050234079360962, 0.4892673194408417, 0.544901430606842, 0.6914811730384827, 0.998407781124115, 0.7626924514770508, 0.8734461665153503, 0.9998961687088013, 0.978775143623352, 0.9876068234443665, 0.9221463799476624, 0.9752353429794312, 0.9999247193336487, 0.9999142289161682, 0.970649242401123, 0.9515662789344788]}

Similarly, the phrase \"the actions and decisions of people, whether intentional or not, have a significant impact on our environment and often result in negative consequences\" highlights the importance of being aware of one's actions and their impact on the world. In contrast, positive sentiment phrases often emphasize the importance of taking positive steps towards a better future, such as \"being aware of the importance of trees, sustainable practices, and reducing food waste are positive steps towards a better future.\" Therefore, the negative sentiment subjectivity of the phrase \"person isn't even conscious\" is a reflection of the frustration and disappointment that can arise when people are not taking responsibility for their actions and", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "person", "isn", "'", "t", "even",

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity for the sentiment phrase 'risk' is negative due to its association with potential harm and uncertainty.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "r", "isk", "'", "is", "negative", ".", "The", "word", "'", "r", "isk", "'", "is", "often", "associated", "with", "danger", ",", "uncertainty", ",", "and", "potential", "harm", ",", "which", "can", "ev", "oke", "feelings", "of", "fear", ",", "anxiety", ",", "and", "concern", ".", "In", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", ",", "the", "mention", "of", "a", "'", "food", "access", "crisis", "'", "and", "a", "'", "food", "availability", "crisis", "'", "implies", "a", "potential", "lack", "or", "short", "age", "of", "food", ",", "which", "can", "have", "serious", "consequences", "for", "individuals", "and", "communities", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "r", "isk", "'", "is", "negative", "due", "to", "its", "association", "with", "potential", "harm", "and", "uncertainty", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8511608839035034, 0.7628172636032104, 0.9854027628898621, 0.663626492023468, 0.9999764561653137, 0.7318738698959351, 0.9786434173583984, 0.7725327610969543, 0.999764084815979, 0.8235877156257629, 0.9999492764472961, 1.0, 0.9964351654052734, 0.7071734666824341, 0.9525781273841858, 0.4026886224746704, 0.5263848304748535, 0.5955075025558472, 0.9845551252365112, 0.9995306730270386, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9979878067970276, 0.25755566358566284, 0.5929526686668396, 0.9155876040458679, 0.9999307990074158, 0.3937828242778778, 0.9377040863037109, 0.8218579888343811, 0.9771016836166382, 0.8449788093566895, 0.7936060428619385, 0.9230269193649292, 0.49804237484931946, 0.437256395816803, 0.44440120458602905, 0.40875929594039917, 0.9999986290931702, 0.7702488303184509, 0.9998838305473328, 0.9430594444274902, 0.6538700461387634, 0.7323200702667236, 0.9982638955116272, 0.8528850078582764, 0.3192284107208252, 0.79201740026474, 0.6130276918411255, 0.654961109161377, 0.4765247404575348, 0.9466206431388855, 0.9634367227554321, 0.7406489253044128, 0.7056238651275635, 0.8001099228858948, 0.4587794542312622, 0.9997234344482422, 0.6697871685028076, 0.5909676551818848, 0.9998146891593933, 0.9984796047210693, 0.9987103343009949, 0.9261957406997681, 0.9997344613075256, 0.5641385912895203, 0.9997437000274658, 0.999974250793457, 0.9999983906745911, 0.9999818205833435, 0.991752564907074, 0.23447327315807343, 0.49811339378356934, 0.7653450965881348, 0.3477173149585724, 0.6995858550071716, 0.34599459171295166, 0.9983163475990295, 0.9995681643486023, 0.9112682938575745, 0.7675813436508179, 0.9910358786582947, 0.8239263296127319, 0.3833841383457184, 0.7165506482124329, 0.7503618597984314, 0.9344337582588196, 0.9148960113525391, 0.9928960800170898, 0.9078797101974487, 0.7619941234588623, 0.49925971031188965, 0.9999794960021973, 0.9955316781997681, 0.9133602380752563, 0.5856273770332336, 0.9999648928642273, 0.831529438495636, 0.9638642072677612, 0.9689165353775024, 0.9999025464057922, 0.9992028474807739, 0.9999942183494568, 0.9999788403511047, 0.996243417263031, 0.6011901497840881, 0.995498776435852, 0.3143855333328247, 0.9998751878738403, 0.5740683674812317, 0.3918054699897766, 0.9999976754188538, 0.9384785890579224, 0.959118127822876, 0.9526833295822144, 0.8822607398033142, 0.9138887524604797, 0.9331106543540955]}

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity for the sentiment phrase 'happy' is positive.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "h", "appy", "'", "is", "a", "positive", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "as", "it", "does", "not", "convey", "any", "negative", "emotion", "or", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "text", "or", "its", "context", ".", "The", "text", "discuss", "es", "Bill", "G", "ates", "'", "proposal", "to", "address", "climate", "change", "in", "Africa", ",", "but", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "h", "appy", "'", "is", "not", "related", "to", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "subjects", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", "or", "examples", ",", "such", "as", "the", "prior", "it", "ization", "of", "power", "and", "profit", "over", "the", "environment", "and", "people", "'", "s", "well", "-", "being", ",", "the", "devast", "ating", "consequences", "of", "environmental", "issues", ",", "or", "the", "lack", "of", "action", "and", "account", "ability", "from", "those", "in", "power", ".", "Instead", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "h", "appy", "'", "is", "likely", "un", "related", "to", "the", "text", "'", "s", "content", "and", "may", "simply", "indicate", "a", "positive", "emotional", "state", "or", "feeling", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "h", "appy", "'", "is", "positive", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8854771256446838, 0.846358060836792, 0.9364064335823059, 0.8895213007926941, 0.4963859021663666, 0.9993582963943481, 0.9999905228614807, 0.9998577237129211, 0.6802626848220825, 0.2764219641685486, 0.8746553063392639, 0.9397681951522827, 0.33295050263404846, 0.9990822672843933, 0.4506683051586151, 0.9783148169517517, 0.25896650552749634, 0.9999836087226868, 0.3454950451850891, 0.9202247858047485, 0.9202443361282349, 0.4377061724662781, 0.7933363914489746, 0.337688148021698, 0.8373974561691284, 0.9905358552932739, 0.5071165561676025, 0.40560802817344666, 0.6503865122795105, 0.6795254945755005, 0.8397002220153809, 0.48717278242111206, 0.3222652077674866, 0.36229208111763, 0.9999987483024597, 0.552243173122406, 0.9996016025543213, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9539569020271301, 0.5658660531044006, 0.506936252117157, 0.43408703804016113, 0.9996280670166016, 0.9999734163284302, 0.9882689714431763, 0.9999595880508423, 0.37286698818206787, 0.44656533002853394, 0.8779473900794983, 0.9873873591423035, 0.9981467723846436, 0.5123294591903687, 0.9999836087226868, 0.9999720454216003, 0.9999716877937317, 0.7786491513252258, 0.7989943027496338, 0.9519017934799194, 0.9999109506607056, 0.4684890806674957, 0.4972599446773529, 0.6445367336273193, 0.4885556399822235, 0.2026216685771942, 0.9992474317550659, 0.5281884074211121, 0.9999377727508545, 0.8465362787246704, 0.5705215334892273, 0.6111500859260559, 0.9283918738365173, 0.9999944567680359, 0.572752058506012, 0.42293858528137207, 0.999992311000824, 0.969140350818634, 0.9999986886978149, 0.3279719054698944, 0.595054566860199, 0.8807284832000732, 0.9339682459831238, 0.9539101123809814, 0.9634494185447693, 0.7934520244598389, 0.34649139642715454, 0.4325789511203766, 0.9999733567237854, 0.9610132575035095, 0.9908234477043152, 0.9999862313270569, 0.6197096705436707, 0.5355096459388733, 0.31980234384536743, 0.9940819144248962, 0.9730179905891418, 0.9948439598083496, 0.7202414870262146, 0.2607356309890747, 0.9901719689369202, 0.9363806843757629, 0.9918690919876099, 0.5629549026489258, 0.9999989867210388, 0.8092690706253052, 0.9919601082801819, 0.9998952150344849, 0.9999997019767761, 0.8831338286399841, 0.9866578578948975, 0.9999801516532898, 0.9999852776527405, 0.9960584044456482, 0.6545085310935974, 0.9999955296516418, 0.7577739357948303, 0.9760872721672058, 0.9865038990974426, 0.7373427152633667, 0.9999755024909973, 0.9999905228614807, 0.9999786019325256, 0.3096391558647156, 0.6630370020866394, 0.6859583258628845, 0.9988370537757874, 0.9974961280822754, 0.9997941255569458, 0.8927882313728333, 0.8603156208992004, 0.999989926815033, 0.8614194989204407, 0.8650231957435608, 0.3952077031135559, 0.3500628173351288, 0.31913861632347107, 0.9437476992607117, 0.8417236804962158, 0.5921121835708618, 0.5166003108024597, 0.6350169777870178, 0.28966715931892395, 0.267403781414032, 0.5861002802848816, 0.999995768070221, 0.8939909934997559, 0.9966588020324707, 0.948209285736084, 0.9999978542327881, 0.5943103432655334, 0.9444564580917358, 0.8226819634437561, 0.9998977780342102, 0.9943892359733582, 0.9999638199806213, 0.9999818205833435, 0.9999762177467346, 0.8317325711250305, 0.7604525685310364, 0.8469516038894653, 0.9724385738372803]}

In the given text, the phrase 'phase out dirty fuels' suggests that the council is planning to eliminate the use of dirty fuels, which could be seen as a positive step towards addressing the climate crisis. However, the negative sentiment subjectivity of the phrase 'phase out' itself can overshadow the positive intent of the context and create a sense of unease or resistance to change. This is evident in the background knowledge provided, which expresses a negative sentiment towards the idea of phasing out fossil fuels and focusing on imaginary clean energy instead.

Some individuals and organizations are focusing on reducing their impact on the environment, while others are striving for greater efficiency and sustainability. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research can be seen as a call for more productive and sustainable farming practices. Similarly, policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6 are essential for agriculture's long-term health. In the energy sector, renewable energy is becoming increasingly important, with safer and more efficient options gaining popularity over fossil fuels. Urban planning is another area where change is happening, with a focus on creating healthier societies through more time spent with fewer faces. In the realm of waste management, there is a growing emphasis on reusables and recycling, rather than simply dumping rubbish in the ground.

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity of the sentiment phrase 'largest exporter' should not be influenced by the overall sentiment of the text.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "larg", "est", "ex", "porter", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "itself", "does", "not", "convey", "any", "positive", "or", "negative", "emotion", ",", "but", "rather", "describes", "a", "fact", "ual", "situation", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "in", "the", "text", "is", "not", "directly", "related", "to", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", ",", "but", "rather", "to", "the", "negative", "impact", "of", "Russia", "'", "s", "domin", "ance", "in", "the", "nuclear", "market", "and", "the", "desire", "for", "South", "Korea", "to", "increase", "its", "presence", "in", "this", "market", ".", "The", "positive", "sentiment", "in", "the", "text", "is", "related", "to", "the", "potential", "for", "a", "more", "sustainable", "and", "efficient", "future", "through", "the", "use", "of", "renew", "able", "energy", "and", "other", "e", "co", "-", "friendly", "alternatives", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "larg", "est", "ex", "porter", "'", "should", "not", "be", "influenced", "by", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.858568549156189, 0.8008497953414917, 0.9762014746665955, 0.8087702393531799, 0.9999814033508301, 0.7458352446556091, 0.9776197075843811, 0.6554270386695862, 0.9998266696929932, 0.6064066290855408, 0.9994670748710632, 1.0, 0.9999877214431763, 0.9999831318855286, 0.9998117089271545, 0.8349668979644775, 0.7101730108261108, 0.7520232796669006, 0.45784011483192444, 0.3272886574268341, 0.981080949306488, 0.739124596118927, 0.7165272831916809, 0.9996436238288879, 0.4367706775665283, 0.5684870481491089, 0.7408178448677063, 0.9997861385345459, 0.9999482035636902, 0.5635122060775757, 0.4184403121471405, 0.37854957580566406, 0.7330880761146545, 0.18766586482524872, 0.9655392169952393, 0.992863118648529, 0.7679251432418823, 0.8116211891174316, 0.909168541431427, 0.4271872937679291, 0.3237135112285614, 0.8140968084335327, 0.6295138001441956, 0.9996154308319092, 0.9744396209716797, 0.43058356642723083, 0.7336054444313049, 0.5752324461936951, 0.9823900461196899, 0.9999901056289673, 0.8982877731323242, 0.9918845891952515, 0.9936288595199585, 0.5264440774917603, 0.6004704833030701, 0.9466800093650818, 0.5930696725845337, 0.9914077520370483, 0.47219622135162354, 0.4080384373664856, 0.9170302152633667, 0.531588613986969, 0.8408888578414917, 0.9999977350234985, 0.6921694278717041, 0.9999943971633911, 0.9932361245155334, 0.9847643375396729, 0.9841837286949158, 0.777511715888977, 0.5518154501914978, 0.8373398780822754, 0.5372645854949951, 0.8007702231407166, 0.991443395614624, 0.9998621940612793, 0.9999991655349731, 0.3681515157222748, 0.9997199773788452, 0.44137394428253174, 0.8725084662437439, 0.8174992799758911, 0.998425304889679, 0.9934355616569519, 0.4397324025630951, 0.7392258048057556, 0.7171043157577515, 0.957457959651947, 0.9998705983161926, 0.9408302903175354, 0.7093425393104553, 0.692115843296051, 0.9999839067459106, 0.9864572286605835, 0.37157681584358215, 0.6865321397781372, 0.2984369099140167, 0.8772685527801514, 0.9989838600158691, 0.9076772928237915, 0.9668198227882385, 0.9860652685165405, 0.5590211153030396, 0.4487885534763336, 0.8406445980072021, 0.9966210722923279, 0.470951110124588, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9980399012565613, 0.9614734649658203, 0.4738782048225403, 0.7184195518493652, 0.9999989867210388, 1.0, 0.999919056892395, 0.9815893173217773, 0.8473859429359436, 0.3718385100364685, 0.9999916553497314, 0.997098982334137, 0.9974581599235535, 0.9735026955604553, 0.9999986290931702, 0.8972100019454956, 0.9395465850830078, 0.987142026424408, 0.999866247177124, 0.6431053876876831, 0.9997708201408386, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999916553497314, 0.9999250769615173, 0.9999926686286926, 0.515660285949707, 0.7731531262397766, 0.9978951215744019, 0.8959127068519592, 0.9999083280563354, 0.9918368458747864, 0.8178824186325073, 0.9951499700546265, 0.9978777170181274, 0.999999463558197, 0.9999852776527405, 0.6704858541488647, 0.7613544464111328]}
