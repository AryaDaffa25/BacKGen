However, without more context, it's impossible to definitively classify it as positive or negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "do", "better", "\"", "is", "neutral", "as", "it", "can", "be", "interpreted", "as", "a", "call", "for", "improvement", ",", "which", "can", "be", "positive", "or", "negative", "depending", "on", "the", "context", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "it", "seems", "to", "be", "a", "call", "for", "ethical", "and", "sustainable", "practices", ",", "which", "is", "generally", "considered", "positive", ".", "However", ",", "without", "more", "context", ",", "it", "'", "s", "impossible", "to", "definit", "ively", "class", "ify", "it", "as", "positive", "or", "negative", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "\"", "do", "better", "\"", "is", "neutral", ".", "\n", "Reason", "=", "\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "do", "better", "\"", "is", "neutral", "because", "it", "can", "be", "interpreted", "as", "a", "call", "for", "improvement", ",", "which", "can", "have", "positive", "or", "negative", "con", "notations", "depending", "on", "the", "context", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "it", "seems", "to", "be", "a", "call", "for", "ethical", "and", "sustainable", "practices", ",", "which", "is", "generally", "considered", "positive", ".", "However", ",", "without", "more", "context", ",", "it", "'", "s", "impossible", "to", "definit", "ively", "class", "ify", "it", "as", "positive", "or", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7075168490409851, 0.8151757717132568, 0.9569558501243591, 0.48551470041275024, 0.8766611218452454, 0.9978976249694824, 0.9999934434890747, 0.9993333220481873, 0.5211527943611145, 0.507897675037384, 0.5934923887252808, 0.9975531697273254, 0.4570813775062561, 0.6525046229362488, 0.9396110773086548, 0.9780435562133789, 0.4639214873313904, 0.7584120631217957, 0.5162153244018555, 0.995954155921936, 0.44849517941474915, 0.8680686950683594, 0.7472941279411316, 0.7643177509307861, 0.697023332118988, 0.8444156050682068, 0.9999405145645142, 0.9705323576927185, 0.9998792409896851, 0.9973924160003662, 0.9886398315429688, 0.8493281006813049, 0.5279496908187866, 0.7915249466896057, 0.7202026844024658, 0.9998216032981873, 0.269609272480011, 0.3706127107143402, 0.807772159576416, 0.6354155540466309, 0.4354197680950165, 0.4775432050228119, 0.9738446474075317, 0.4806370735168457, 0.31870540976524353, 0.807700514793396, 0.7825090885162354, 0.6707524657249451, 0.5851420164108276, 0.3682806193828583, 0.6079989075660706, 0.5698426365852356, 0.7063395380973816, 0.2751517593860626, 0.9706488251686096, 0.9999635219573975, 0.687990128993988, 0.45168736577033997, 0.8489659428596497, 0.9134222865104675, 0.9659125804901123, 0.4587360918521881, 0.9999990463256836, 0.6460655331611633, 0.999998927116394, 0.5159419775009155, 0.9999980926513672, 0.8156588077545166, 0.9999810457229614, 0.9291620850563049, 0.9999970197677612, 0.9945793151855469, 0.9381941556930542, 0.9999713897705078, 0.6499739289283752, 0.39918333292007446, 0.9999946355819702, 0.5375348329544067, 0.8086013793945312, 0.9906216859817505, 0.9999982118606567, 0.4936838448047638, 0.38602256774902344, 0.9998281002044678, 0.999990701675415, 0.9999932050704956, 0.9728721976280212, 0.9674927592277527, 0.6766853928565979, 0.5717921257019043, 0.634186863899231, 0.7242879867553711, 0.7729989290237427, 0.8355326056480408, 0.9535442590713501, 0.983391284942627, 0.9995030164718628, 0.9999513626098633, 0.9999951124191284, 0.9999744892120361, 0.6013574004173279, 0.46055302023887634, 0.7931935787200928, 0.9998506307601929, 0.9795214533805847, 0.54979008436203, 0.9949571490287781, 0.9832121729850769, 0.8712064027786255, 0.9809501767158508, 0.9997443556785583, 0.9974210262298584, 0.9870898127555847, 0.9877930283546448, 0.9910022616386414, 0.5295838117599487, 0.8545872569084167, 0.9997542500495911, 0.999983549118042, 0.9673131108283997, 0.9999450445175171, 0.9928135275840759, 0.9999955892562866, 0.9999748468399048, 0.9837005734443665, 0.9955535531044006, 0.9669598937034607, 0.955931544303894, 0.8988761305809021, 0.9999998807907104, 0.6227590441703796, 0.6772310733795166, 0.9999336004257202, 0.9983881711959839, 0.9863764643669128, 0.9932157397270203, 0.9999792575836182, 0.995823860168457, 0.9999877214431763, 0.9999682903289795, 0.9999815225601196, 0.999723494052887, 0.985925018787384, 0.9979708790779114, 0.9996163845062256, 0.996565043926239, 0.9995716214179993, 0.5387697815895081, 0.99540776014328, 0.9999984502792358, 0.9546337127685547, 0.9336872100830078, 0.9688993096351624, 0.9996240139007568, 0.9975537657737732, 0.9947817921638489, 0.9999996423721313, 0.999314546585083, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9926170706748962, 0.9999078512191772, 0.995380163192749, 0.9999994039535522, 0.999991774559021, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9999222755432129, 0.9996287822723389, 0.9999673366546631, 0.9681236147880554, 0.6952322721481323]}

The phrase \"at the expense\" implies a trade-off or sacrifice, which is often associated with negative sentiment. In this context, the phrase suggests that progress towards a low-carbon transition may come at the cost of something else, such as social justice, which is generally considered a negative outcome. However, the overall sentiment of the text is positive, as it emphasizes the importance of well-managed low-carbon transitions for achieving most SDGs and creating economic opportunities.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["Neg", "ative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", ".", "The", "phrase", "\"", "at", "the", "expense", "\"", "implies", "a", "trade", "-", "off", "or", "sacrifice", ",", "which", "is", "often", "associated", "with", "negative", "sentiment", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "phrase", "suggests", "that", "progress", "towards", "a", "low", "-", "car", "bon", "transition", "may", "come", "at", "the", "cost", "of", "something", "else", ",", "such", "as", "social", "justice", ",", "which", "is", "generally", "considered", "a", "negative", "outcome", ".", "However", ",", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", "is", "positive", ",", "as", "it", "emphas", "izes", "the", "importance", "of", "well", "-", "managed", "low", "-", "car", "bon", "transitions", "for", "achieving", "most", "SD", "G", "s", "and", "creating", "economic", "opportunities", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.5009505152702332, 0.9999949932098389, 0.5778641104698181, 0.9301912784576416, 0.9999362230300903, 0.23238179087638855, 0.8368865251541138, 0.42337465286254883, 0.6644942760467529, 0.9999246597290039, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9999666213989258, 0.8312885165214539, 0.5268933773040771, 0.5638726949691772, 0.4315001368522644, 0.9807351231575012, 0.9999699592590332, 0.7623708844184875, 0.48364830017089844, 0.8673166036605835, 0.42056459188461304, 0.2898828983306885, 0.35251784324645996, 0.8237897157669067, 0.9998012185096741, 0.8086777925491333, 0.664290726184845, 0.27014288306236267, 0.4229179322719574, 0.8871764540672302, 0.9077328443527222, 0.9997850060462952, 0.4929613471031189, 0.21064341068267822, 0.8259016275405884, 0.9845484495162964, 0.2869630455970764, 0.75162273645401, 0.43387696146965027, 0.9852761030197144, 0.5512752532958984, 0.9999738931655884, 0.9999997615814209, 0.7222499847412109, 0.6699579358100891, 0.7824680805206299, 0.9937335848808289, 0.9460166692733765, 0.9568115472793579, 0.8394504189491272, 0.635649561882019, 0.8637436032295227, 0.9717020988464355, 0.5251331329345703, 0.9999146461486816, 0.9988886713981628, 0.9999487400054932, 0.621671736240387, 0.7362800240516663, 0.881854772567749, 0.4052143692970276, 0.6859871745109558, 0.7459364533424377, 0.9936178922653198, 0.7212196588516235, 0.8172831535339355, 0.36588239669799805, 0.9998831748962402, 0.9179792404174805, 0.7533377408981323, 0.4216564893722534, 0.9390106797218323, 0.9999654293060303, 0.9940621256828308, 0.763037919998169, 0.8650977611541748, 0.6042312979698181, 0.5797105431556702, 0.8903157711029053, 0.8040585517883301, 0.9998608827590942, 0.9985389709472656, 0.8637235164642334, 0.6953054666519165, 0.42230767011642456, 0.9988210797309875, 0.9998643398284912, 0.7392231225967407, 0.8846753835678101, 0.9999876022338867, 0.9999992847442627, 0.9999688863754272, 0.5773223638534546, 0.9977774024009705, 0.4370473623275757, 0.7913894653320312, 0.999809205532074, 0.9999282360076904, 0.7772032022476196, 0.6956210136413574, 0.5510095357894897, 0.9999266862869263, 0.5901023149490356, 0.6361273527145386]}
