Nevertheless, the overall sentiment towards cost increases as a roadblock is negative based on the provided text and background knowledge.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "an", "increase", "in", "cost", "is", "often", "seen", "as", "a", "road", "block", "'", "implies", "that", "the", "increase", "in", "cost", "is", "perceived", "as", "a", "hind", "r", "ance", "or", "obst", "acle", ".", "This", "sentiment", "is", "negative", "as", "it", "suggests", "that", "the", "increase", "in", "cost", "is", "und", "es", "irable", "and", "may", "prevent", "progress", "towards", "a", "goal", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "also", "supports", "this", "classification", "as", "it", "contains", "several", "negative", "sent", "iments", "related", "to", "costs", "and", "negative", "impacts", "on", "the", "environment", ".", "However", ",", "it", "'", "s", "important", "to", "note", "that", "the", "text", "also", "ment", "ions", "that", "some", "firms", "report", "no", "change", "or", "even", "a", "decrease", "in", "costs", "due", "to", "sustainable", "product", "design", ",", "which", "could", "challenge", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "cost", "increases", "in", "this", "context", ".", "Nevertheless", ",", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "towards", "cost", "increases", "as", "a", "road", "block", "is", "negative", "based", "on", "the", "provided", "text", "and", "background", "knowledge", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9787499904632568, 0.4698549211025238, 0.9999970197677612, 0.5714330077171326, 0.9447925686836243, 0.9799326062202454, 0.9999451637268066, 0.9999821186065674, 0.9978151321411133, 0.8462126851081848, 0.45637214183807373, 0.41915902495384216, 0.9996986389160156, 0.6121650338172913, 0.600013017654419, 0.9999942779541016, 0.999998927116394, 0.9999783039093018, 0.9974775910377502, 0.999982476234436, 0.9999456405639648, 0.9999693632125854, 0.9998873472213745, 0.9995055198669434, 0.9999977350234985, 0.9984172582626343, 0.2820259630680084, 0.9179078936576843, 0.4551265835762024, 0.4493080973625183, 0.9994581341743469, 0.9761137962341309, 0.6739810705184937, 0.3260153830051422, 0.9019147157669067, 0.6604845523834229, 0.7734010815620422, 0.9999635219573975, 0.999996542930603, 0.9036890864372253, 0.7860024571418762, 0.9980948567390442, 0.3579869866371155, 0.25641900300979614, 0.6134191155433655, 0.6292180418968201, 0.43435704708099365, 0.3540871739387512, 0.8576686382293701, 0.5237273573875427, 0.42885228991508484, 0.6734100580215454, 0.5305153727531433, 0.9771226644515991, 0.9962367415428162, 0.9173593521118164, 0.2554936408996582, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9941880702972412, 0.669013500213623, 0.42694735527038574, 0.7851738929748535, 0.47001805901527405, 0.5948209166526794, 0.5803762078285217, 0.8622331023216248, 0.546187162399292, 0.5382294654846191, 0.8987686634063721, 0.9644283056259155, 0.6999980211257935, 0.41682401299476624, 0.7850940823554993, 0.8354330062866211, 0.47646963596343994, 0.6234793066978455, 0.15361912548542023, 0.5789214968681335, 0.957915186882019, 0.77336186170578, 0.9999947547912598, 0.8122100830078125, 0.9999986886978149, 0.5711190700531006, 0.83098965883255, 0.5515308380126953, 0.5585842728614807, 0.9739236831665039, 0.9996278285980225, 0.9999921321868896, 0.9876577854156494, 0.6041131019592285, 0.9999547004699707, 0.7610355019569397, 0.5468294620513916, 0.9999998807907104, 0.941896378993988, 0.9999938011169434, 0.9879314303398132, 0.992457389831543, 0.6719951629638672, 0.3779539167881012, 0.9244859218597412, 0.8035998940467834, 0.9999991655349731, 0.930692732334137, 0.8477336764335632, 0.9921106696128845, 0.9373089671134949, 0.7408624291419983, 0.9997358918190002, 0.9660705327987671, 0.9348737597465515, 0.9985281229019165, 0.999261200428009, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9999412298202515, 0.9515551924705505, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9998829364776611, 0.9994094371795654, 0.9999743700027466, 0.6987545490264893, 0.8402615785598755, 0.39411666989326477, 0.3336045444011688, 0.957942008972168, 0.3654058873653412, 0.54115229845047, 0.43818584084510803, 0.5918118953704834, 0.9778645634651184, 0.5921237468719482, 0.731788158416748, 0.8394696116447449, 0.9945967197418213, 0.24845634400844574, 0.999998927116394, 0.6237225532531738, 0.7630637288093567, 0.6398277878761292, 0.6992959380149841, 0.5938712954521179, 0.9967290163040161, 0.40518486499786377, 0.9122933149337769, 0.9416487216949463, 0.9999970197677612, 0.4886170029640198, 0.9266873002052307, 0.6019913554191589, 0.9999978542327881, 0.998497724533081, 0.6509730219841003, 0.5274515748023987, 0.6938266158103943, 0.9948484897613525, 0.999809205532074, 0.9999643564224243, 0.9920899868011475]}

However, based on the background knowledge, a 'green tick' could be interpreted as a positive sign, as it is often associated with eco-friendliness, sustainability, and environmental consciousness. This is in line with the positive sentiment of the background sentences that mention 'green spaces' and 'green education'. Therefore, the classification is 'positive'.\n\nExplanation:\nThe term 'green tick' in the text refers to a symbol or mark indicating that Rwanda has certain eco-friendly or sustainable practices, as evidenced by its presence in the 'climate change section' on Statistica ebeanotalks ebeanosquare. Given the positive sentiment of the background knowledge related to 'green spaces' and 'green education', it is reasonable to assume that a 'green tick' in this context is a positive sign. This is because it suggests that Rwanda is taking steps towards sustainability and environmental consciousness, which are generally viewed as positive attributes.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The",

The negative sentiment of the background knowledge also supports this classification.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "term", "'", "un", "law", "ful", "'", "implies", "that", "an", "action", "or", "situation", "is", "not", "in", "accordance", "with", "the", "law", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "US", "court", "ruling", "that", "Q", "R", "codes", "in", "lieu", "of", "G", "MO", "label", "ing", "are", "'", "un", "law", "ful", "'", "suggests", "that", "the", "use", "of", "Q", "R", "codes", "instead", "of", "clear", "label", "ing", "is", "not", "permitted", "by", "law", ".", "This", "is", "a", "negative", "outcome", ",", "as", "laws", "are", "put", "in", "place", "to", "protect", "consumers", "and", "ensure", "trans", "parency", ",", "particularly", "in", "regards", "to", "potentially", "harmful", "sub", "stances", "such", "as", "gen", "et", "ically", "modified", "organ", "isms", "(", "G", "MO", "s", ").", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "of", "the", "background", "knowledge", "also", "supports", "this", "classification", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.732143759727478, 0.6195946931838989, 0.9999967813491821, 0.5283922553062439, 0.9602570533752441, 0.980891764163971, 0.9999090433120728, 0.9999901056289673, 0.9967784285545349, 0.7806301712989807, 0.8548566102981567, 0.5701701045036316, 0.9949924349784851, 0.9999818801879883, 0.999996542930603, 0.9999997615814209, 0.9992586970329285, 0.18665504455566406, 0.7005335688591003, 0.4051220417022705, 0.983659029006958, 0.6360918283462524, 0.8194907307624817, 0.9504560232162476, 0.49690282344818115, 0.4307553172111511, 0.982470691204071, 0.9997773766517639, 0.9862143397331238, 0.9991593360900879, 0.8367878198623657, 0.7130361199378967, 0.8291128277778625, 0.8189998269081116, 0.9995356798171997, 0.9010435342788696, 0.6946809887886047, 0.929368257522583, 0.5155342817306519, 0.700627326965332, 0.9917513728141785, 0.9999946355819702, 0.9996693134307861, 0.8855979442596436, 0.8901628255844116, 0.9999713897705078, 0.9973239898681641, 0.9999940395355225, 0.972475528717041, 0.9999996423721313, 0.6837155222892761, 0.5125555992126465, 0.9999988079071045, 0.9999945163726807, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9916960597038269, 0.518254280090332, 0.8755841851234436, 0.8005244135856628, 0.48847445845603943, 0.999943733215332, 0.9073147177696228, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9999780654907227, 0.7781860828399658, 0.9999856948852539, 0.6528748869895935, 0.3123927712440491, 0.9999879598617554, 0.47590354084968567, 0.5352658629417419, 0.23770983517169952, 0.6825706958770752, 0.8476732969284058, 0.9520933628082275, 0.47572413086891174, 0.3365417420864105, 0.9304764270782471, 0.9963030815124512, 0.48978307843208313, 0.46889257431030273, 0.9804934859275818, 0.3843126595020294, 0.6629794836044312, 0.5296253561973572, 0.9988940358161926, 0.999998927116394, 0.986034095287323, 0.9560019373893738, 0.5661277770996094, 0.8855171203613281, 0.8091490864753723, 0.9456573724746704, 0.9999994039535522, 0.4114971458911896, 0.5937708616256714, 0.39141595363616943, 0.28297144174575806, 0.9999967813491821, 0.30706846714019775, 0.8475373983383179, 0.5158811807632446, 0.9999998807907104, 0.3769162595272064, 0.9999748468399048, 0.7982872128486633, 0.9999939203262329, 0.9999997615814209, 0.9987793564796448, 0.999885082244873, 0.9999876022338867, 0.6659701466560364, 0.9996345043182373, 0.9999815225601196, 0.9998645782470703, 0.9953287839889526, 0.547264575958252, 0.5729349255561829, 0.8496173620223999, 0.6363739371299744, 0.5480222105979919, 0.9751128554344177, 0.6599848866462708, 0.3364098072052002, 0.778226375579834, 0.9667686223983765, 0.7734020352363586, 0.7408308386802673, 0.871705174446106]}

The removal of cardboard boxes may lead to job losses for those involved in the manufacturing and distribution of these boxes.

The user's realization that even 'weed' is technically GMO further emphasizes this nuanced perspective.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "not", "everything", "g", "mo", "is", "evil", "'", "is", "a", "positive", "statement", ".", "The", "user", "acknowled", "ges", "that", "there", "is", "a", "common", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "G", "MO", "s", ",", "but", "they", "are", "express", "ing", "a", "more", "nu", "anced", "perspective", ".", "This", "perspective", "is", "positive", "because", "it", "challenges", "the", "overs", "impl", "ification", "of", "G", "MO", "s", "as", "inher", "ently", "evil", "and", "encour", "ages", "a", "more", "thought", "ful", "consideration", "of", "the", "issue", ".", "The", "user", "'", "s", "realization", "that", "even", "'", "we", "ed", "'", "is", "technically", "G", "MO", "further", "emphas", "izes", "this", "nu", "anced", "perspective", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.98853999376297, 0.6963721513748169, 0.849251389503479, 0.9998254179954529, 0.6369802355766296, 0.9997841715812683, 0.9999585151672363, 0.998113751411438, 0.9999940395355225, 0.9996558427810669, 0.9999988079071045, 0.9990183115005493, 0.43703001737594604, 0.7689108848571777, 0.9739646911621094, 0.9807195067405701, 0.5782791376113892, 0.26984772086143494, 0.2476428747177124, 0.4227844476699829, 0.9999921321868896, 0.9627267718315125, 0.4995027184486389, 0.6679288744926453, 0.8426496982574463, 0.431488960981369, 0.9377681612968445, 0.9943947792053223, 0.8439784049987793, 0.5804055333137512, 0.9999672174453735, 0.9956348538398743, 0.63121497631073, 0.9431042671203613, 0.7656382918357849, 0.6440128684043884, 0.457682341337204, 0.9999996423721313, 0.5375134944915771, 0.5133835077285767, 0.9975428581237793, 0.9999980926513672, 0.5804221630096436, 0.5249742269515991, 0.5154047012329102, 0.5878785252571106, 0.33884525299072266, 0.4111625552177429, 0.44440317153930664, 0.9805915951728821, 0.34569886326789856, 0.8890847563743591, 0.33131852746009827, 0.9998878240585327, 0.6585580706596375, 0.4992823600769043, 0.5485363006591797, 0.9999750852584839, 0.9998291730880737, 0.8869196176528931, 0.8165124654769897, 0.9999843835830688, 0.8830786943435669, 0.5818786025047302, 0.30334821343421936, 0.9999994039535522, 0.6372190713882446, 0.9895700216293335, 0.7127283811569214, 0.9999934434890747, 0.45340538024902344, 0.9962359070777893, 0.5596684217453003, 0.5913508534431458, 0.9973922967910767, 0.3773214519023895, 0.49485325813293457, 0.3113372325897217, 0.999997615814209, 0.39591890573501587, 0.558434247970581, 0.8913236856460571, 0.41687270998954773, 0.8603400588035583, 0.9999309778213501, 0.9172160625457764, 0.9195793867111206, 0.9974977374076843, 0.5167630314826965, 0.9999905824661255, 0.342334121465683, 0.370257169008255, 0.9999971389770508, 0.4594656527042389, 0.6048856973648071, 0.9371470212936401, 0.837105393409729, 0.9137547016143799, 0.2500001788139343]}

However, it is important to note that banning plastic bags can be a positive act when it is done with the intention of protecting the environment and reducing harm to wildlife and ecosystems.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "ban", "plastic", "bags", "'", "is", "classified", "as", "'", "negative", "'", "based", "on", "the", "provided", "text", ".", "The", "user", "express", "es", "frustration", "with", "the", "current", "recycl", "ing", "system", "and", "the", "idea", "of", "b", "anning", "plastic", "bags", "is", "presented", "as", "a", "solution", "to", "this", "problem", ".", "However", ",", "the", "sentiment", "towards", "b", "anning", "plastic", "bags", "is", "negative", "in", "the", "text", ",", "as", "it", "is", "presented", "as", "a", "'", "h", "odge", "pod", "ge", "'", "and", "'", "rid", "ic", "ulous", "'", "solution", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "supports", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "b", "anning", "sub", "stances", "or", "practices", "is", "typically", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "when", "it", "is", "seen", "as", "restrict", "ive", "or", "harmful", "to", "individuals", "or", "businesses", ".", "However", ",", "it", "is", "important", "to", "note", "that", "b", "anning", "plastic", "bags", "can", "be", "a", "positive", "act", "when", "it", "is", "done", "with", "the", "intention", "of", "protecting", "the", "environment", "and", "reducing", "harm", "to", "wildlife", "and", "ecosystem", "s", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9867505431175232, 0.7405804991722107, 0.7569328546524048, 0.999512791633606, 0.6907624006271362, 0.9999840259552002, 0.9999939203262329, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9996923208236694, 0.5749788284301758, 0.36931726336479187, 0.999881386756897, 0.6633135676383972, 0.9570561051368713, 0.8654245138168335, 0.5128071904182434, 0.9999369382858276, 0.9463334083557129, 0.25445154309272766, 0.5982468724250793, 0.466825932264328, 0.6688234210014343, 0.35266903042793274, 0.4894302189350128, 0.9998306035995483, 0.7980542778968811, 0.43301716446876526, 0.8978137969970703, 0.6961748600006104, 0.5214126110076904, 1.0, 0.9436192512512207, 0.6345200538635254, 0.16831126809120178, 0.22439220547676086, 0.9501018524169922, 0.5713860392570496, 0.9992183446884155, 0.9795427322387695, 0.9999812841415405, 0.6449957489967346, 0.3517874479293823, 0.8026140928268433, 0.7499778866767883, 0.6536183953285217, 0.41739127039909363, 0.5179765224456787, 0.725635290145874, 0.9000958800315857, 0.6325170397758484, 0.9998990297317505, 0.6705924868583679, 0.7675246000289917, 0.36308419704437256, 0.4268535375595093, 0.9990450739860535, 0.8826159834861755, 0.9999854564666748, 0.7719587683677673, 0.5154889822006226, 0.37393414974212646, 0.8353196978569031, 0.5495024919509888, 0.3242605924606323, 0.3876802921295166, 0.5990044474601746, 0.8539493083953857, 0.22906608879566193, 0.6030718684196472, 0.7213366627693176, 0.9169702529907227, 0.9997941851615906, 0.9993564486503601, 0.9718442559242249, 0.9999985694885254, 0.6398645043373108, 0.4429967403411865, 0.8160306215286255, 0.9992185831069946, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9999908208847046, 0.9993332028388977, 0.6883904933929443, 0.8853362798690796, 0.2299554944038391, 0.45786431431770325, 0.9856281280517578, 0.5055182576179504, 0.8031596541404724, 0.9603469967842102, 0.46083199977874756, 0.9797793030738831, 0.3526249825954437, 0.9178416132926941, 0.39426523447036743, 0.9999997615814209, 0.9326989054679871, 0.9999476671218872, 0.7123062014579773, 0.39987456798553467, 0.724532961845398, 0.9062492251396179, 0.7122312188148499, 0.9051042199134827, 0.7346867918968201, 0.4343937039375305, 0.3082709014415741, 0.9995877146720886, 0.3305673599243164, 0.9783679246902466, 0.9183334708213806, 0.46949711441993713, 0.7399322390556335, 0.9515597224235535, 0.5355556607246399, 0.52056884765625, 0.9481397867202759, 0.44203439354896545, 0.9999827146530151, 0.7448403239250183, 0.6420093178749084, 0.9533535838127136, 0.9999879598617554, 0.969685971736908, 0.999542236328125, 0.4689227044582367, 0.9998713731765747, 0.9996671676635742, 0.9999994039535522, 0.4632202088832855, 0.6141197681427002, 0.9737054705619812, 0.9913424253463745, 0.9460829496383667, 0.7671674489974976, 0.736009418964386, 0.8693723678588867, 0.8208025693893433, 0.47779643535614014, 0.9996482133865356, 0.8344786763191223, 0.9453396201133728, 0.9009063839912415, 0.7346389293670654, 0.999976634979248, 0.47842180728912354, 0.6896478533744812, 0.7111917734146118, 0.5166108012199402, 0.43891602754592896, 0.8420308828353882, 0.6306378245353699, 0.9999372959136963, 0.9895046949386597, 0.3801247775554657]}

The background knowledge does not contradict this interpretation, as using renewable energy sources is generally considered a positive step towards reducing carbon footprint and promoting sustainability.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Pos", "itive", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "phrase", "'", "up", "a", "level", "'", "implies", "an", "improvement", "or", "enhancement", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "green", "gas", "support", "scheme", "is", "being", "described", "as", "taking", "government", "support", "for", "net", "zero", "up", "a", "level", ".", "This", "improvement", "is", "likely", "in", "reference", "to", "the", "renew", "able", "heat", "incent", "ive", "scheme", "for", "bi", "om", "eth", "ane", ",", "which", "suggests", "that", "the", "new", "scheme", "is", "more", "effective", "or", "beneficial", "than", "the", "previous", "one", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "does", "not", "contrad", "ict", "this", "interpretation", ",", "as", "using", "renew", "able", "energy", "sources", "is", "generally", "considered", "a", "positive", "step", "towards", "reducing", "carbon", "foot", "print", "and", "promoting", "sustain", "ability", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9796918034553528, 0.4648553133010864, 0.9999926090240479, 0.6777665019035339, 0.8973298072814941, 0.9713847041130066, 0.9999440908432007, 0.9999841451644897, 0.9978076815605164, 0.8954306244850159, 0.799773633480072, 0.44589242339134216, 0.8892090320587158, 0.9192693829536438, 0.9999992847442627, 0.9999914169311523, 0.9995476603507996, 0.2677083909511566, 0.6301699876785278, 0.8284932971000671, 0.9190294146537781, 0.6329969167709351, 0.4558797776699066, 0.5196404457092285, 0.6370892524719238, 0.9549188613891602, 0.9988263249397278, 0.5634511709213257, 0.5157354474067688, 0.9999567270278931, 0.9997754693031311, 0.9999386072158813, 0.7652933597564697, 0.3362356722354889, 0.6930081844329834, 0.9997614026069641, 0.4448140263557434, 0.914195716381073, 0.9994237422943115, 0.9878688454627991, 0.9893060326576233, 0.9967435598373413, 0.40553537011146545, 0.9778560996055603, 0.9978010058403015, 0.5577746033668518, 0.2699090242385864, 0.30798742175102234, 0.5448997020721436, 0.6027791500091553, 0.27905312180519104, 0.6851678490638733, 0.9999922513961792, 0.8536282181739807, 0.8393017053604126, 0.9999922513961792, 0.9841920137405396, 0.9999794960021973, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9991694688796997, 0.971735417842865, 0.9999953508377075, 0.9999927282333374, 0.9999994039535522, 0.9999995231628418, 0.8826890587806702, 0.812803328037262, 0.273456871509552, 0.7600291967391968, 0.8081862330436707, 0.9715791940689087, 0.9510555863380432, 0.8522160649299622, 0.37897270917892456, 0.9197763800621033, 0.9520601630210876, 0.28710147738456726, 0.6243006587028503, 0.8440919518470764, 0.8473088145256042, 0.9999178647994995, 0.9538478255271912, 0.46114593744277954, 0.5250603556632996, 0.9506909847259521, 0.6469898223876953, 0.9990062117576599, 0.2600068151950836, 0.9999984502792358, 0.907414436340332, 0.6258738040924072, 0.5092503428459167, 0.6198080778121948, 0.45102792978286743, 0.7268829345703125, 0.9999997615814209, 0.9990591406822205, 0.9687869548797607, 0.8629915118217468, 0.6070353984832764, 0.7338598966598511, 0.9340248703956604, 0.9947518706321716, 0.6301853656768799, 0.5810977220535278, 0.44988977909088135, 0.9775437712669373, 0.9121446013450623, 0.9923141598701477, 0.9957992434501648, 0.9893757104873657, 0.9998530149459839, 0.9999994039535522, 0.9863005876541138, 0.7380877137184143]}

Therefore, the sentiment of the target phrase is negative as it suggests that the current actions are insufficient in addressing the negative issues.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "phrase", "'", "pr", "ay", "ing", "aren", "'", "t", "cutting", "it", "'", "implies", "that", "the", "current", "actions", ",", "which", "are", "prayer", ",", "are", "not", "effective", "in", "addressing", "the", "issues", "at", "hand", ".", "The", "issues", "mentioned", "in", "the", "text", "are", "the", "d", "rought", "and", "poor", "air", "quality", ",", "both", "of", "which", "are", "negative", "experiences", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "also", "supports", "this", "classification", "as", "it", "states", "that", "the", "threat", "of", "death", ",", "which", "can", "be", "in", "ferred", "from", "the", "negative", "impact", "of", "the", "d", "rought", "and", "poor", "air", "quality", ",", "is", "a", "negative", "experience", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "is", "negative", "as", "it", "suggests", "that", "the", "current", "actions", "are", "ins", "ufficient", "in", "addressing", "the", "negative", "issues", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8632346391677856, 0.7919674515724182, 0.9999943971633911, 0.5736509561538696, 0.9488206505775452, 0.9805260300636292, 0.9999220371246338, 0.999883770942688, 0.9976685643196106, 0.8093733787536621, 0.7341768741607666, 0.5452623963356018, 0.545426070690155, 0.985072672367096, 0.9996795654296875, 1.0, 0.9997195601463318, 0.9888743162155151, 0.9997571110725403, 0.9999834299087524, 0.9999812841415405, 0.9995530247688293, 0.338033527135849, 0.6456961631774902, 0.6680619120597839, 0.6084408164024353, 0.7568667531013489, 0.41848647594451904, 0.6545203924179077, 0.6716304421424866, 0.3525090217590332, 0.7280526161193848, 0.9765510559082031, 0.3959961235523224, 0.8268160820007324, 0.5669131875038147, 0.8004783391952515, 0.9951556921005249, 0.5317494869232178, 0.584813117980957, 0.9999954700469971, 0.5304814577102661, 0.4153800308704376, 0.35551005601882935, 0.34083911776542664, 0.5244113802909851, 0.9993694424629211, 0.9580812454223633, 0.5932436585426331, 0.8538711071014404, 0.5083182454109192, 0.9999914169311523, 0.7651873826980591, 0.8188683390617371, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9999783039093018, 0.6900038719177246, 0.5405561923980713, 0.9854627847671509, 0.999975323677063, 0.6754122972488403, 0.9039421081542969, 0.9986324906349182, 0.40025606751441956, 0.32944637537002563, 0.34361162781715393, 0.9651781916618347, 0.4079941511154175, 0.6426871418952942, 0.5102683901786804, 0.6201271414756775, 0.4760178327560425, 0.889352560043335, 0.6439352631568909, 0.9947667121887207, 0.9074161648750305, 0.9903286099433899, 0.9999942779541016, 0.9872257113456726, 0.9299803376197815, 0.5466338396072388, 0.5968506932258606, 0.7757141590118408, 0.33495837450027466, 0.9955710768699646, 0.5431061387062073, 0.798688530921936, 0.5908961892127991, 0.23001989722251892, 0.9983605742454529, 0.7205585241317749, 0.9919028878211975, 0.99993896484375, 0.9982165694236755, 0.9887914657592773, 0.9999992847442627, 0.9999796152114868, 0.9995802044868469, 0.9999805688858032, 0.9987945556640625, 0.9997074007987976, 0.999987006187439, 0.9985490441322327, 0.33731964230537415, 0.9999204874038696, 0.9209442734718323, 0.382489413022995, 0.449083149433136, 0.8837754130363464, 0.9624270796775818, 0.9998759031295776, 0.797711193561554, 0.9889182448387146, 0.6251048445701599, 0.6984532475471497, 0.6207704544067383, 0.7750575542449951, 0.914005696773529, 0.957192599773407, 0.9036175608634949, 0.8229363560676575, 0.40548083186149597, 0.9999936819076538, 0.5886498093605042, 0.3772340416908264, 0.6963351368904114, 0.5979723334312439, 0.6318875551223755, 0.9633176922798157, 0.9835313558578491]}

The background knowledge also supports this classification, as it describes negative emotions as a common sentiment subjectivity stereotype.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "term", "'", "h", "yster", "ical", "'", "carries", "a", "negative", "con", "notation", ",", "imp", "lying", "excessive", "and", "irr", "ational", "emotional", "reactions", ".", "The", "speaker", "is", "recall", "ing", "how", "the", "Gre", "ens", ",", "an", "environmental", "advoc", "acy", "group", ",", "would", "react", "strongly", "to", "oil", "sp", "ills", "that", "har", "med", "birds", ".", "The", "speaker", "seems", "to", "be", "critic", "izing", "their", "reactions", "as", "over", "bl", "own", "and", "irr", "ational", ".", "This", "sentiment", "is", "consistent", "with", "the", "negative", "definition", "of", "'", "h", "yster", "ical", "'.", "The", "background", "knowledge", "also", "supports", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "it", "describes", "negative", "emotions", "as", "a", "common", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "stere", "otype", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9496544003486633, 0.6525841355323792, 0.9999964237213135, 0.6375294327735901, 0.9438351988792419, 0.9819602966308594, 0.9999425411224365, 0.9999915361404419, 0.9975113868713379, 0.797505795955658, 0.7756513357162476, 0.41993722319602966, 0.9575526118278503, 0.9999872446060181, 0.9999380111694336, 0.9999971389770508, 0.998993456363678, 0.29794710874557495, 0.9575312733650208, 0.9458010196685791, 0.5937965512275696, 0.9999887943267822, 0.4955857992172241, 0.41222041845321655, 0.9999957084655762, 0.3872186839580536, 0.32828018069267273, 0.6272754073143005, 0.9997392296791077, 0.6355363130569458, 0.2399330586194992, 0.8585528135299683, 0.4433647394180298, 0.23450937867164612, 0.3320866823196411, 0.45757147669792175, 0.9999997615814209, 0.26787278056144714, 0.5207180380821228, 0.4795893132686615, 0.9999998807907104, 0.3484223783016205, 0.7778268456459045, 0.9808854460716248, 0.44561460614204407, 0.9999938011169434, 0.9984225034713745, 0.9992547631263733, 0.32232555747032166, 0.6372367143630981, 0.6301363110542297, 0.7237918972969055, 0.940329372882843, 0.9999769926071167, 0.9999284744262695, 0.4790761172771454, 0.5548980832099915, 0.9999886751174927, 0.8185836672782898, 0.7213348150253296, 0.3406289517879486, 0.15805338323116302, 0.24821889400482178, 0.9854834079742432, 0.3712253272533417, 0.23458610475063324, 0.9965992569923401, 0.6165562868118286, 0.2948470115661621, 0.8309861421585083, 0.4927935004234314, 0.32599711418151855, 0.999983549118042, 0.3566216826438904, 0.2049059122800827, 0.9999392032623291, 0.6183472275733948, 0.31559181213378906, 0.500243067741394, 0.5058017373085022, 0.32509326934814453, 0.9999574422836304, 0.9780837893486023, 0.8015839457511902, 0.7312891483306885, 0.8790765404701233, 0.4547322690486908, 0.9999799728393555, 0.9959666728973389, 0.9999762773513794, 0.5278265476226807, 0.5147311091423035, 0.8443050980567932, 0.9069430232048035, 0.3010995090007782, 0.7835890650749207, 0.606117844581604, 0.526528537273407, 0.5565173029899597, 0.9339454174041748, 0.45470649003982544, 0.2430402636528015, 0.4438641667366028, 0.8916703462600708, 0.47994089126586914, 0.8968420624732971, 0.8955478072166443, 0.924490749835968, 0.9703989624977112, 0.9999796152114868, 0.9979311227798462, 0.9999964237213135, 0.685257613658905, 0.6109891533851624]}
