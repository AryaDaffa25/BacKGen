For example, if the text mentioned that activists were transforming abandoned land into a toxic waste dump, then the sentiment subjectivity for the sentiment phrase 'transform' would be negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "transform", "'", "in", "the", "given", "text", "is", "neutral", ".", "The", "reason", "is", "that", "the", "word", "'", "transform", "'", "itself", "does", "not", "carry", "a", "positive", "or", "negative", "con", "notation", ",", "and", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", "is", "about", "activ", "ists", "transform", "ing", "abandoned", "land", "to", "build", "food", "sovere", "ig", "nt", "y", ",", "which", "is", "generally", "considered", "a", "positive", "action", ".", "However", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "classification", "result", "can", "change", "depending", "on", "the", "specific", "context", "and", "sentiment", "phrases", "used", "in", "the", "text", ".", "For", "example", ",", "if", "the", "text", "mentioned", "that", "activ", "ists", "were", "transform", "ing", "abandoned", "land", "into", "a", "toxic", "waste", "dump", ",", "then", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "transform", "'", "would", "be", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8179692625999451, 0.8231014013290405, 0.9790421724319458, 0.5633081793785095, 0.9999021291732788, 0.6737949848175049, 0.9645026922225952, 0.642606258392334, 0.9997131824493408, 0.6938104629516602, 0.9996309280395508, 0.9965840578079224, 0.4520396590232849, 0.8318474292755127, 0.4874524772167206, 0.8351103663444519, 0.854614794254303, 0.3588046431541443, 0.4575282037258148, 0.5952155590057373, 0.5779206156730652, 0.7245248556137085, 0.9651523232460022, 0.7976887226104736, 0.4820981025695801, 0.9803743958473206, 0.9998995065689087, 0.9985557794570923, 0.41831082105636597, 0.45385703444480896, 0.9989848732948303, 0.4025978446006775, 0.4521539807319641, 0.7833702564239502, 0.9953725337982178, 0.9989191889762878, 0.4448316693305969, 0.9999796152114868, 0.3134458661079407, 0.3589026927947998, 0.43584248423576355, 0.46958622336387634, 0.5664601922035217, 0.9715320467948914, 0.8125616908073425, 0.33249562978744507, 0.7895249724388123, 0.8705357909202576, 0.9995865821838379, 0.25285014510154724, 0.9998986124992371, 0.9995622634887695, 0.9984787106513977, 0.6461255550384521, 0.9989325404167175, 0.9999770522117615, 0.9999838471412659, 0.999997079372406, 0.9997371435165405, 1.0, 0.925260066986084, 0.9959524869918823, 0.8372474312782288, 0.8496903777122498, 0.5099899172782898, 0.8643786907196045, 0.9955719113349915, 0.9353547096252441, 0.7907460927963257, 0.8191469311714172, 0.9999976754188538, 0.416421115398407, 0.3391742706298828, 0.731839120388031, 0.9999977350234985, 0.6368288993835449, 0.34565165638923645, 0.30884066224098206, 0.6708700656890869, 0.66888827085495, 0.9999859929084778, 0.9973575472831726, 0.8470734357833862, 0.9006692171096802, 0.5281257033348083, 0.6373887062072754, 0.49928876757621765, 0.41252636909484863, 0.959922194480896, 0.9764654040336609, 0.9941652417182922, 0.8000642657279968, 0.9071340560913086, 0.6731561422348022, 0.9999902844429016, 0.954326868057251, 0.9996700882911682, 0.9471642971038818, 0.22079861164093018, 0.5228321552276611, 0.4379349648952484, 0.9999901056289673, 0.8864986896514893, 0.7797912359237671, 0.9999997019767761, 0.3853065073490143, 0.9897295832633972, 0.7687599062919617, 0.7826269268989563, 0.7896733283996582, 0.9743139743804932, 0.7272435426712036, 0.9903216361999512, 0.5912539958953857, 0.9990736842155457, 0.9998461008071899, 0.9983249306678772, 0.9999989867210388, 0.6862849593162537, 0.8879875540733337, 0.7123153805732727, 0.9998979568481445, 0.9997161030769348, 0.9999735355377197, 0.9999925494194031, 0.9985371828079224, 0.9964857697486877, 0.9999057054519653, 0.9938443899154663, 0.6751118898391724]}

Therefore, the sentiment phrase 'great' is a positive sentiment subjectivity.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "g", "reat", "'", "is", "subject", "ively", "positive", "as", "it", "conve", "ys", "a", "sense", "of", "adm", "iration", ",", "approval", ",", "or", "excell", "ence", "towards", "the", "role", "for", "someone", "with", "a", "passion", "for", "parks", "and", "green", "spaces", ".", "The", "positive", "sentiment", "is", "rein", "forced", "by", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", "which", "ment", "ions", "the", "words", "'", "g", "reat", "role", "'", "and", "'", "pass", "ion", "for", "parks", "and", "green", "spaces", "'.", "The", "background", "knowledge", "list", "also", "supports", "the", "positive", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "as", "it", "states", "that", "st", "riving", "for", "a", "health", "ier", "future", "is", "a", "comm", "end", "able", "goal", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "g", "reat", "'", "is", "a", "positive", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9022916555404663, 0.7694714665412903, 0.9812808632850647, 0.8106588125228882, 0.5978831052780151, 0.9997681975364685, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9992163181304932, 0.6561824679374695, 0.5153802633285522, 0.7896744608879089, 0.9983817338943481, 0.36947715282440186, 0.9550787806510925, 0.33183518052101135, 0.999998152256012, 0.8529768586158752, 0.8786880373954773, 0.9999566674232483, 0.6724811792373657, 0.9999644160270691, 0.5221855640411377, 0.4993819296360016, 0.7060494422912598, 0.7856523990631104, 0.41011402010917664, 0.9999892115592957, 0.5970592498779297, 0.9078117609024048, 0.5342361330986023, 0.420933336019516, 0.9904352426528931, 0.7685670256614685, 0.9860694408416748, 0.6235331296920776, 0.9999186992645264, 0.9990689158439636, 0.9998721480369568, 0.9999001026153564, 0.9999896883964539, 0.5959305167198181, 0.3301021158695221, 0.21882319450378418, 0.8710913062095642, 0.6465315818786621, 0.49708884954452515, 0.9996293783187866, 0.9074392914772034, 0.9763903617858887, 0.26421263813972473, 0.7084627151489258, 0.9798327088356018, 0.8286607265472412, 0.5047220587730408, 0.18908661603927612, 0.9999995231628418, 0.52353835105896, 0.3660847544670105, 0.9720168113708496, 0.8834896087646484, 0.9999855756759644, 0.9681507349014282, 0.9258117079734802, 0.8861437439918518, 0.8599233627319336, 0.7052863836288452, 0.9999976754188538, 0.5934993028640747, 0.9998610019683838, 0.9752668738365173, 0.9999896883964539, 0.9999957084655762, 0.6251950860023499, 0.43045422434806824, 0.6892015337944031, 0.998837947845459, 0.44158512353897095, 0.6150926351547241, 0.6213988065719604, 0.4213462173938751, 0.8154062032699585, 0.9535955786705017, 0.3087632358074188, 0.9999052286148071, 0.338810533285141, 0.7381770014762878, 0.24700792133808136, 0.6909533739089966, 0.8355799913406372, 0.9999809265136719, 0.9975243210792542, 0.9993720054626465, 0.9973146319389343, 1.0, 0.9996876120567322, 0.9809390902519226, 0.8457478880882263, 0.9991757273674011, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9999538064002991, 0.8968696594238281, 0.22959919273853302, 0.9990056753158569, 0.9318593144416809, 0.961706817150116, 0.8073084950447083, 0.8585094809532166, 0.9999500513076782, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9997004270553589, 0.77740478515625, 0.44630467891693115, 0.9438656568527222, 0.7369754910469055, 0.462960422039032, 0.9985554218292236, 0.3534582555294037, 0.8683003783226013]}

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity of the sentiment phrase \"negative\" in this context is negative due to its expression of a negative sentiment towards a specific issue mentioned in the text.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "negative", "\"", "in", "this", "context", "is", "subject", "ive", "and", "can", "be", "interpreted", "as", "express", "ing", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "problems", "astronom", "ers", "are", "facing", "with", "Space", "X", "satell", "ites", ",", "which", "is", "a", "specific", "issue", "mentioned", "in", "the", "text", ".", "The", "sentiment", "is", "negative", "because", "it", "highlights", "the", "difficulties", "and", "challenges", "that", "astronom", "ers", "are", "encounter", "ing", "due", "to", "the", "bright", "ness", "of", "the", "Space", "X", "satell", "ites", ",", "making", "it", "harder", "for", "them", "to", "observe", "objects", "in", "space", ".", "This", "negative", "sentiment", "is", "not", "related", "to", "any", "broader", "moral", "or", "ethical", "issues", ",", "such", "as", "pollution", "or", "explo", "itation", ",", "and", "is", "instead", "focused", "on", "the", "practical", "challenges", "faced", "by", "astronom", "ers", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "negative", "\"", "in", "this", "context", "is", "negative", "due", "to", "its", "expression", "of", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "a", "specific", "issue", "mentioned", "in", "the", "text", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9130212664604187, 0.8340668082237244, 0.8577195405960083, 0.7838183045387268, 0.5513232350349426, 0.998193085193634, 0.9984762668609619, 0.2750033438205719, 0.5163475275039673, 0.6218492984771729, 0.4821833670139313, 0.37889450788497925, 0.9195126295089722, 0.7605215311050415, 0.16740354895591736, 0.6785051822662354, 0.3153468072414398, 0.6309254169464111, 0.5741992592811584, 0.9999822378158569, 0.4979766607284546, 0.7211835384368896, 0.6949296593666077, 0.9798113703727722, 0.6842883825302124, 0.23588041961193085, 0.6853868365287781, 0.999995231628418, 0.9745197892189026, 0.7445976734161377, 0.48644253611564636, 0.8441588878631592, 0.9991292953491211, 0.9907701015472412, 0.9999588131904602, 0.2257472723722458, 0.29031994938850403, 0.22956781089305878, 0.45395931601524353, 0.34002500772476196, 0.7811936736106873, 0.6204636096954346, 0.9796926975250244, 0.9999270439147949, 0.993272066116333, 0.8946025371551514, 0.5163170695304871, 0.40381085872650146, 0.47178465127944946, 0.8157609701156616, 0.8398004174232483, 0.6874341368675232, 0.5085892677307129, 0.8987308144569397, 0.48752519488334656, 0.8702163696289062, 0.4489952027797699, 0.36316531896591187, 0.8162936568260193, 0.9999997019767761, 0.8038029670715332, 0.6927263736724854, 0.9999999403953552, 0.40531498193740845, 0.9999508261680603, 0.7988530397415161, 0.7357009649276733, 0.993660569190979, 0.9935420155525208, 0.6831804513931274, 0.6961268782615662, 0.9999969005584717, 0.9998353719711304, 0.9999875426292419, 0.716988205909729, 0.7043745517730713, 0.9998444318771362, 0.9586507081985474, 0.9947942495346069, 0.9999490976333618, 0.9999951124191284, 0.8376668095588684, 0.38884103298187256, 0.5716818571090698, 0.9962115287780762, 0.8736012578010559, 0.4718967378139496, 0.207096129655838, 0.949691891670227, 0.7771077156066895, 0.5147322416305542, 0.4681214392185211, 0.9999592304229736, 0.38100579380989075, 0.7830740809440613, 0.21275053918361664, 0.420432448387146, 0.9798150062561035, 0.5247970223426819, 0.6444474458694458, 0.4428243041038513, 0.9999944567680359, 0.36437711119651794, 0.9674345254898071, 0.5294727087020874, 0.9995498061180115, 0.7935652136802673, 0.28489241003990173, 0.39370301365852356, 0.3226914405822754, 0.9853916168212891, 0.9982706904411316, 0.8711735010147095, 0.43846359848976135, 0.6133107542991638, 0.7485322952270508, 0.9906182885169983, 0.5824170112609863, 1.0, 0.5624357461929321, 0.4902060925960541, 0.9985140562057495, 0.9367784261703491, 0.992972731590271, 0.9250975251197815, 0.9999944567680359, 0.7284247279167175, 0.7986957430839539, 0.810268759727478, 0.9998188018798828, 0.8351070880889893, 0.9998239278793335, 0.9998986124992371, 0.6206476092338562, 0.9952223896980286, 0.9851119518280029, 0.9240809082984924, 0.8636326789855957, 0.7968186736106873, 0.9999366402626038, 0.8720371723175049, 0.4062608480453491, 0.9999878406524658, 0.7091720104217529, 0.31967803835868835, 0.9846312403678894, 0.9927228093147278, 0.6567468643188477, 0.9910814166069031, 0.9541471004486084, 0.6031154990196228, 0.9998465776443481, 0.999999463558197, 0.9999395608901978, 0.9982854127883911, 0.7936499714851379]}
