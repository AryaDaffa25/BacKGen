In the energy sector, renewable energy is becoming increasingly important, with safer and more efficient options gaining popularity over fossil fuels. Urban planning is another area where change is happening, with a focus on creating healthier societies through more time spent with fewer faces. In the realm of waste management, there is a growing emphasis on reusables and recycling, rather than simply dumping rubbish in the ground.

The sentiment phrase also implies a cynical and dismissive attitude towards efforts to address climate change, which is likely to evoke negative emotions and reinforce a sense of despair and hopelessness.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "is", "'", "negative", "'.", "The", "reason", "is", "that", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "express", "es", "a", "belief", "that", "climate", "change", "is", "a", "'", "fab", "ric", "ated", "lie", "'", "used", "to", "'", "control", "profits", "'", "and", "'", "gain", "power", "over", "humanity", "',", "and", "it", "advoc", "ates", "for", "the", "abol", "ition", "of", "a", "carbon", "tax", ",", "which", "is", "a", "policy", "intended", "to", "address", "climate", "change", ".", "This", "perspective", "is", "in", "direct", "opposition", "to", "the", "widespread", "consensus", "that", "climate", "change", "is", "a", "real", "and", "pressing", "issue", "that", "requires", "urgent", "action", ",", "and", "it", "dismiss", "es", "the", "potential", "negative", "consequences", "of", "un", "checked", "carbon", "emissions", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "also", "implies", "a", "c", "yn", "ical", "and", "dismiss", "ive", "attitude", "towards", "efforts", "to", "address", "climate", "change", ",", "which", "is", "likely", "to", "ev", "oke", "negative", "emotions", "and", "reinforce", "a", "sense", "of", "despair", "and", "hop", "eless", "ness", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.6402161717414856, 0.6635367274284363, 0.9584333300590515, 0.622850775718689, 0.9999912977218628, 0.749211311340332, 0.9820360541343689, 0.6928197741508484, 0.9971784949302673, 0.9999114274978638, 0.4760589897632599, 0.7974647879600525, 0.7880224585533142, 0.4960280954837799, 0.7847771644592285, 0.3411780893802643, 0.7813165783882141, 0.9648332595825195, 0.9842537641525269, 0.6074018478393555, 0.9960311651229858, 0.7158958315849304, 0.9998999238014221, 0.6683943271636963, 0.34794852137565613, 0.9644303917884827, 0.9656163454055786, 0.9999768733978271, 0.9963253736495972, 0.9963611364364624, 0.612423300743103, 0.9954694509506226, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9992695450782776, 0.9092605113983154, 0.604667067527771, 0.5050289034843445, 0.49832117557525635, 0.9898726940155029, 0.9995658993721008, 0.7657482624053955, 0.9980279803276062, 0.9575603604316711, 0.9811886548995972, 0.9999865889549255, 0.4833623170852661, 0.9999955296516418, 0.7168802618980408, 0.47549760341644287, 0.47299593687057495, 0.6236701607704163, 0.9999948740005493, 0.9444372057914734, 0.6842110753059387, 0.27792391180992126, 0.986554741859436, 0.9994185566902161, 0.6498144268989563, 0.685121476650238, 0.9999933838844299, 0.6949520111083984, 0.8000823259353638, 0.7867313623428345, 0.41632455587387085, 0.5071971416473389, 0.4906295835971832, 0.9999796152114868, 0.40946677327156067, 0.7822378873825073, 0.9999099373817444, 0.7888150215148926, 0.6175628900527954, 0.489718496799469, 0.6186614036560059, 0.3037228286266327, 0.4284765124320984, 0.9292094111442566, 0.9999949336051941, 0.8849836587905884, 0.21994172036647797, 0.5409269332885742, 0.7469478845596313, 0.9542070627212524, 0.9999829530715942, 0.9998579025268555, 0.9683693647384644, 0.6391823887825012, 0.9514229893684387, 0.9485375881195068, 0.8174550533294678, 0.7570674419403076, 0.9266666769981384, 0.5400359630584717, 0.940255880355835, 0.5148516297340393, 0.9652547836303711, 0.8672298789024353, 0.09742032736539841, 0.9649620652198792, 0.9922127723693848, 0.41834530234336853, 0.5050457715988159, 0.9572771787643433, 0.9838343858718872, 0.3343552052974701, 0.9936713576316833, 0.8910477161407471, 0.9995406866073608, 0.4237220883369446, 0.5195437073707581, 0.49563565850257874, 0.591118335723877, 0.3802744150161743, 0.37660863995552063, 0.7307981252670288, 0.33784884214401245, 0.9999769926071167, 0.9988270401954651, 0.4710894227027893, 0.377963125705719, 0.9999982118606567, 0.9796657562255859, 0.9927175045013428, 0.7029575109481812, 0.9998339414596558, 0.697516918182373, 0.8255561590194702, 0.9999722838401794, 0.7197180390357971, 0.6542083621025085, 0.5622904300689697, 0.3718486428260803, 0.9999687671661377, 0.5627647638320923, 0.9999987483024597, 0.7098417282104492, 0.9627923965454102, 0.3299388289451599, 0.20575271546840668, 0.4722481369972229, 0.9330543875694275, 0.9999086856842041, 0.5678050518035889, 0.7526723146438599, 0.943564236164093, 0.9999727010726929, 0.9999978542327881, 0.610521674156189, 0.43331384658813477]}

In fact, many countries, like India, have prioritized a green and clean environment as their first focus. This commitment is reflected in various initiatives, such as the development of dual waste collection trucks, the transformation of the UK into a climate crisis leader, and the invention of new technologies to minimize plastic waste.

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity of the sentiment phrase should be evaluated based on its own meaning and context, rather than the overall sentiment of the text.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "pl", "astic", "neutral", "'", "is", "'", "pos", "itive", "'.", "This", "is", "because", "the", "phrase", "'", "pl", "astic", "neutral", "'", "implies", "a", "commitment", "to", "reducing", "the", "use", "of", "plastic", "in", "food", "deliver", "ies", ",", "which", "is", "a", "positive", "step", "towards", "environmental", "sustain", "ability", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "in", "the", "text", "is", "not", "directly", "related", "to", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", ",", "but", "rather", "to", "the", "author", "'", "s", "ske", "ptic", "ism", "towards", "Z", "om", "ato", "'", "s", "commitment", "to", "net", "zero", "emissions", "and", "the", "potential", "negative", "impact", "of", "their", "actions", "on", "their", "fundament", "als", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "should", "be", "evaluated", "based", "on", "its", "own", "meaning", "and", "context", ",", "rather", "than", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7657216787338257, 0.8613121509552002, 0.9620614647865295, 0.917899489402771, 0.9999929070472717, 0.7798738479614258, 0.962619423866272, 0.5524115562438965, 0.9978867769241333, 0.9998640418052673, 0.7773228883743286, 0.9998700022697449, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9997933506965637, 0.9998000264167786, 0.9170263409614563, 0.8023117780685425, 0.9120912551879883, 0.9999996423721313, 0.5413692593574524, 0.400074303150177, 0.842387855052948, 0.9936031699180603, 0.9421684145927429, 0.5156090259552002, 0.2674707770347595, 0.9994440674781799, 0.9999979138374329, 0.9999299645423889, 0.9995357990264893, 0.3039436638355255, 0.6428133249282837, 0.29200267791748047, 0.7100421190261841, 0.9820718169212341, 0.612570583820343, 0.9131125211715698, 0.9128913879394531, 0.9895354509353638, 0.6105667352676392, 0.9961127042770386, 0.9923549890518188, 1.0, 0.9762958884239197, 0.9772949814796448, 0.8506008386611938, 0.7745397686958313, 0.9088509678840637, 0.6676786541938782, 0.9935790300369263, 0.4652763605117798, 0.9998375177383423, 0.9999992251396179, 0.529254674911499, 0.31190189719200134, 0.3150295913219452, 0.6078313589096069, 0.6834291815757751, 0.9998820424079895, 0.9471131563186646, 0.5303203463554382, 0.7766243815422058, 0.4907638430595398, 0.9932899475097656, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9670524597167969, 0.943468451499939, 0.9780784845352173, 0.5395597815513611, 0.7564033269882202, 0.9765385389328003, 0.8336530923843384, 0.988841712474823, 0.6011633276939392, 0.9999731183052063, 0.9999987483024597, 0.43274226784706116, 0.9983236789703369, 0.9999986886978149, 0.49409422278404236, 0.8239588141441345, 1.0, 0.9999943971633911, 0.9999915957450867, 0.9999983310699463, 0.7979379892349243, 0.5907633304595947, 0.6917679309844971, 0.9987329244613647, 0.5574480295181274, 0.7910584211349487, 0.35110926628112793, 0.35978081822395325, 0.44509387016296387, 0.8229413628578186, 0.5001017451286316, 0.5391618609428406, 0.9389813542366028, 0.76860111951828, 0.6474594473838806, 0.5069477558135986, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9986554980278015, 0.33078157901763916, 0.9999704360961914, 0.9953660368919373, 0.9775680899620056, 0.9357185959815979, 0.9999979138374329, 0.7506378889083862, 0.8490412831306458, 0.8457889556884766, 0.9998869895935059, 0.5192936658859253, 0.7339476346969604, 0.3701707124710083, 0.5891833901405334, 0.9995648860931396, 0.9550952911376953, 0.773614227771759, 0.5569058060646057, 0.6889392137527466, 0.7254627346992493, 0.8615301847457886, 0.3718681335449219, 0.9999982118606567, 0.9762065410614014, 0.7635461091995239, 0.8567078709602356, 0.9950603246688843, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9995315670967102, 0.9799579977989197, 0.9123516082763672]}

The sentiment phrase 'is a scam' fits well within this context, as it implies that the subject is engaging in deceptive or fraudulent behavior, and therefore poses a risk to those who interact with it.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "is", "a", "sc", "am", "'", "is", "'", "negative", "'.", "The", "reason", "is", "that", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "conve", "ys", "a", "strong", "sense", "of", "dist", "rust", "and", "suspicion", "towards", "the", "subject", ",", "imp", "lying", "that", "it", "is", "not", "to", "be", "trusted", "or", "rel", "ied", "upon", ".", "This", "sentiment", "is", "consistent", "with", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "stere", "ot", "ypes", "provided", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", ",", "which", "often", "port", "ray", "the", "world", "as", "being", "filled", "with", "harmful", "sub", "stances", "and", "practices", "that", "pose", "significant", "risks", "to", "our", "health", "and", "well", "-", "being", ",", "and", "the", "perpet", "r", "ators", "of", "these", "problems", "as", "being", "ex", "empt", "from", "the", "consequences", ",", "leaving", "the", "rest", "of", "us", "to", "suffer", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "is", "a", "sc", "am", "'", "fits", "well", "within", "this", "context", ",", "as", "it", "implies", "that", "the", "subject", "is", "engaging", "in", "de", "cept", "ive", "or", "fraud", "ulent", "behavior", ",", "and", "therefore", "pos", "es", "a", "risk", "to", "those", "who", "interact", "with", "it", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.6625739336013794, 0.8392528891563416, 0.9237977266311646, 0.5038319826126099, 0.999991238117218, 0.679611325263977, 0.9776753187179565, 0.6453863978385925, 0.9964021444320679, 0.9997892379760742, 0.5883079171180725, 0.9998975396156311, 1.0, 0.9999989867210388, 1.0, 0.9997921586036682, 0.9875237941741943, 0.5253469347953796, 0.8381947875022888, 0.4421728253364563, 0.5597468614578247, 0.5732225775718689, 0.739820659160614, 0.9518830180168152, 0.9084910154342651, 0.47204428911209106, 0.9960151314735413, 0.32768383622169495, 0.9999748468399048, 0.9638046026229858, 0.6991583108901978, 0.27235350012779236, 0.9999688267707825, 0.684083878993988, 0.9999803900718689, 0.8145584464073181, 0.44362297654151917, 0.568612813949585, 0.46123918890953064, 0.6997678875923157, 0.3401487171649933, 0.505113422870636, 0.9999852776527405, 0.8553158640861511, 0.838945209980011, 0.9447264671325684, 0.3875715732574463, 0.27910980582237244, 0.9999995231628418, 0.968134880065918, 0.5871841311454773, 0.8940882086753845, 0.9999961853027344, 0.9951952695846558, 0.5779426097869873, 0.6650486588478088, 0.33572447299957275, 0.6902397871017456, 0.6425461769104004, 0.999993085861206, 0.6886089444160461, 0.8772909045219421, 0.680237352848053, 0.647253692150116, 0.8677902817726135, 0.9972174763679504, 0.23595382273197174, 0.7551923394203186, 0.9960779547691345, 0.9923741221427917, 0.9998751282691956, 0.9140236973762512, 0.8757308721542358, 0.39057397842407227, 0.3040478229522705, 0.72158282995224, 0.6183708310127258, 0.9986822605133057, 0.9176920056343079, 0.4625587463378906, 0.4030989408493042, 0.9999987483024597, 0.7131553292274475, 0.9037227630615234, 1.0, 0.6928686499595642, 0.9993828535079956, 0.49842020869255066, 0.6585732698440552, 0.504589319229126, 0.9992217421531677, 0.9451238512992859, 0.9813255071640015, 0.9751394987106323, 0.9992839097976685, 0.997329831123352, 0.9984652400016785, 0.9999905228614807, 0.6268764734268188, 0.5062286257743835, 0.43232524394989014, 0.9851130247116089, 0.9999694228172302, 0.9999386072158813, 0.9833837747573853, 0.9899383783340454, 0.9851972460746765, 0.9473212361335754, 0.8956030607223511, 0.3420462906360626, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9998127818107605, 0.9569771885871887, 0.9999805092811584, 0.4224105477333069, 0.9914002418518066, 0.9757430553436279, 0.9948333501815796, 0.9999960064888, 0.9999901056289673, 0.9999974966049194, 0.9999213218688965, 0.9996035695075989, 0.42451778054237366, 0.6179925203323364, 0.9648148417472839, 0.3056277334690094, 0.9999377727508545, 0.9999983906745911, 0.9999989867210388, 1.0, 0.9991458654403687, 0.532608151435852, 0.5642295479774475, 0.45224395394325256, 0.9966318607330322, 0.4290909767150879, 0.6626294255256653, 0.8013365864753723, 0.9988054037094116, 0.6209161281585693, 0.9931739568710327, 0.9876052737236023, 0.9960381984710693, 0.9523175358772278, 0.520965576171875, 0.9999992251396179, 0.44887301325798035, 0.9954068660736084, 0.9999991655349731, 0.8243407607078552, 0.9207100868225098, 0.999999463558197, 0.5111215710639954, 0.47626397013664246, 0.43981218338012695, 0.33353081345558167, 0.4088100790977478, 0.9700413942337036, 0.9999842047691345, 0.5619734525680542, 0.9823182821273804, 0.577724814414978, 0.9976029396057129, 0.6453030705451965, 0.9996960163116455, 0.9995640516281128, 0.9963687658309937, 0.8080654144287109]}
