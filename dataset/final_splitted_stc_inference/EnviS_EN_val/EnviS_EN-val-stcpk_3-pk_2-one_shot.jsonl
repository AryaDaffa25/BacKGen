The background knowledge does not directly relate to the target phrase, but it does provide a general understanding that positive actions, such as increasing investment, can have positive outcomes.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "term", "'", "more", "capital", "'", "is", "a", "neutral", "term", "on", "its", "own", ",", "but", "the", "context", "of", "the", "sentence", "'", "there", "'", "s", "more", "capital", "going", "into", "organic", "agriculture", "than", "ever", "before", "'", "indicates", "a", "positive", "sentiment", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "does", "not", "provide", "any", "direct", "information", "about", "'", "more", "capital", "'", "but", "the", "overall", "positive", "context", "of", "the", "sentence", "is", "enough", "to", "class", "ify", "it", "as", "positive", ".", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "phrase", "'", "more", "capital", "'", "is", "a", "neutral", "term", ",", "but", "the", "sentence", "'", "there", "'", "s", "more", "capital", "going", "into", "organic", "agriculture", "than", "ever", "before", "'", "conve", "ys", "a", "positive", "sentiment", ".", "This", "is", "because", "the", "increase", "in", "capital", "investment", "is", "seen", "as", "a", "positive", "development", "for", "organic", "agriculture", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "does", "not", "directly", "relate", "to", "the", "target", "phrase", ",", "but", "it", "does", "provide", "a", "general", "understanding", "that", "positive", "actions", ",", "such", "as", "increasing", "investment", ",", "can", "have", "positive", "outcomes", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9727702140808105, 0.5463982820510864, 0.35667896270751953, 0.9763384461402893, 0.9110612273216248, 0.9999529123306274, 0.9996997117996216, 0.1919097900390625, 0.5710513591766357, 0.6748495697975159, 0.602059543132782, 0.3026573061943054, 0.9997783303260803, 0.9999289512634277, 0.4513489305973053, 0.6032522916793823, 0.3012631833553314, 0.31072238087654114, 0.25797468423843384, 0.9267677664756775, 0.45498886704444885, 0.28185734152793884, 0.9918695688247681, 0.7301772236824036, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9999932050704956, 0.9999806880950928, 0.9999501705169678, 0.9999876022338867, 0.9997944235801697, 0.9999637603759766, 0.9992569088935852, 0.9999877214431763, 0.9999794960021973, 0.9965447783470154, 0.32292109727859497, 0.9812741875648499, 0.9990617632865906, 0.9014357924461365, 0.8388144373893738, 0.49826645851135254, 0.2301667034626007, 0.9211556315422058, 0.4541100859642029, 0.996970534324646, 0.35274288058280945, 0.5143775343894958, 0.2225239872932434, 0.5338341593742371, 0.2741961181163788, 0.5567414164543152, 0.7098666429519653, 0.9999959468841553, 0.5230183601379395, 0.6042776703834534, 0.5743479132652283, 0.6420797109603882, 0.46826669573783875, 0.4708792269229889, 0.8075442910194397, 0.9642199873924255, 0.8669823408126831, 0.2451162040233612, 0.21645089983940125, 0.9143332242965698, 0.5973125696182251, 0.9999439716339111, 0.8719899654388428, 0.9981656670570374, 0.8186730742454529, 0.9649355411529541, 0.3446892499923706, 0.9970665574073792, 0.8191177845001221, 0.9998648166656494, 0.9999977350234985, 0.9762409329414368, 0.810995876789093, 0.7940308451652527, 0.34253114461898804, 0.9929267764091492, 0.9876816272735596, 0.9999814033508301, 0.9617372751235962, 0.3652971386909485, 0.2442406415939331, 0.7953271865844727, 0.986339807510376, 0.46426329016685486, 0.8349158763885498, 0.6910936236381531, 0.36371302604675293, 0.5784832835197449, 0.997570812702179, 0.9735369682312012, 0.9999969005584717, 0.9999927282333374, 0.9999896287918091, 0.999817430973053, 0.9999889135360718, 0.9999673366546631, 0.9999772310256958, 0.9998480081558228, 0.9999927282333374, 0.9999899864196777, 0.998293936252594, 0.22875496745109558, 0.9999901056289673, 0.9956361651420593, 0.9542337656021118, 0.7440240979194641, 0.9038072824478149, 0.3432399034500122, 0.8387009501457214, 0.9187406897544861, 0.537198543548584, 0.43173471093177795, 0.9920529127120972, 0.9920450448989868, 0.5944571495056152, 0.35088616609573364, 0.24908038973808289, 0.9988657236099243, 0.9442166090011597, 0.5805410146713257, 0.6638755798339844, 0.5999968647956848, 0.614892840385437, 0.9950287938117981, 0.554459273815155, 0.4547120928764343, 0.850959837436676, 0.9774639010429382, 0.6068071126937866, 0.9995706677436829, 0.3757087290287018, 0.3976706266403198, 0.9999836683273315, 0.7515417337417603, 0.6060598492622375, 0.9991756081581116, 0.7209957242012024, 0.9826379418373108, 0.8251364827156067, 0.3205163776874542, 0.2889053523540497, 0.41535550355911255, 0.7979822158813477, 0.5121307373046875, 0.7086532115936279, 0.2798459231853485, 0.9635453224182129, 0.44986453652381897, 0.7325108647346497, 0.9999366998672485, 0.3409478962421417, 0.5560435056686401, 0.9237679839134216, 0.5794649124145508, 0.5499513149261475, 0.5584442019462585, 0.9566637873649597, 0.9971541166305542, 0.6729285717010498]}

Therefore, the term 'crisis' in this context is most likely to have a negative polarity.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "term", "'", "c", "ris", "is", "'", "generally", "carries", "a", "negative", "con", "notation", ",", "as", "it", "implies", "a", "state", "of", "serious", "trouble", "or", "danger", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "text", "ment", "ions", "an", "'", "elect", "ric", "ity", "crisis", "'", "in", "the", "UK", ",", "which", "has", "forced", "the", "government", "to", "borrow", "a", "large", "sum", "of", "money", "to", "subs", "id", "ise", "household", "bills", ".", "This", "situation", "is", "likely", "to", "cause", "financial", "hard", "ship", "for", "many", "people", ",", "and", "the", "background", "knowledge", "also", "suggests", "that", "negative", "events", ",", "such", "as", "the", "climate", "crisis", ",", "can", "have", "serious", "consequences", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "term", "'", "c", "ris", "is", "'", "in", "this", "context", "is", "most", "likely", "to", "have", "a", "negative", "pol", "arity", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8742456436157227, 0.5975840091705322, 0.9999936819076538, 0.6077901721000671, 0.9595828652381897, 0.9793345928192139, 0.9999321699142456, 0.9999920129776001, 0.9968147873878479, 0.796647846698761, 0.7091822624206543, 0.7211011648178101, 0.9932636022567749, 0.9771870970726013, 1.0, 0.9999985694885254, 0.9926887154579163, 0.2766978442668915, 0.31767863035202026, 0.9840406179428101, 0.9985703229904175, 0.9240596294403076, 0.9999877214431763, 0.5267506241798401, 0.23699092864990234, 0.982337474822998, 0.46026965975761414, 0.9539358019828796, 0.3391401767730713, 0.9988359808921814, 0.20195965468883514, 0.6329855918884277, 0.5275155901908875, 0.3205147385597229, 0.8558033108711243, 0.5725849866867065, 0.6020933389663696, 0.8370909094810486, 0.9957298636436462, 0.8012592196464539, 0.30644890666007996, 0.2656228840351105, 0.9999998807907104, 0.7521672248840332, 0.74289470911026, 0.9998778104782104, 0.9999909400939941, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9999593496322632, 0.5023457407951355, 0.39158686995506287, 0.99847811460495, 0.9964860677719116, 0.6613844633102417, 0.8538298606872559, 0.36375561356544495, 0.6347466707229614, 0.9993929862976074, 0.9997623562812805, 0.9984720349311829, 0.7018417716026306, 0.7672820091247559, 0.4373267889022827, 0.8913121819496155, 0.9891493916511536, 0.9999933242797852, 0.8809600472450256, 0.9451524615287781, 0.9999810457229614, 0.6793137192726135, 0.996785044670105, 0.9987820982933044, 0.67708420753479, 0.4994406998157501, 0.8240647912025452, 0.529062807559967, 0.28246641159057617, 0.8687364459037781, 0.7862430810928345, 0.6301562786102295, 0.6451253890991211, 0.9524999260902405, 0.6161656379699707, 0.8765744566917419, 0.6307633519172668, 0.4683813750743866, 0.5174417495727539, 0.2594640552997589, 0.5861104130744934, 0.9826341271400452, 0.15241603553295135, 0.2860235273838043, 0.957425594329834, 0.7013384103775024, 0.6515358686447144, 0.5670176148414612, 0.8801053762435913, 0.999983549118042, 0.6011135578155518, 0.957809329032898, 0.9999680519104004, 0.9940165281295776, 0.7352291941642761, 0.5852290987968445, 0.6910244226455688, 0.4533277451992035, 0.6418817639350891, 0.8785662055015564, 0.9999945163726807, 0.7815065383911133, 0.3153137266635895, 0.999815046787262, 0.9998681545257568, 1.0, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9342643022537231, 0.7859935164451599, 0.9166651368141174, 0.8611403107643127, 0.8201654553413391, 0.585007905960083, 0.9874979257583618, 0.8747029900550842, 0.49275916814804077, 0.9999505281448364, 0.9999688863754272, 0.9200933575630188, 0.9999980926513672, 0.9989891648292542, 0.9921922087669373]}

The background knowledge does not contradict this interpretation, as using renewable energy sources is generally considered a positive step towards reducing carbon footprint and promoting sustainability.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Pos", "itive", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "phrase", "'", "up", "a", "level", "'", "implies", "an", "improvement", "or", "enhancement", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "green", "gas", "support", "scheme", "is", "being", "described", "as", "taking", "government", "support", "for", "net", "zero", "up", "a", "level", ".", "This", "improvement", "is", "likely", "in", "reference", "to", "the", "renew", "able", "heat", "incent", "ive", "scheme", "for", "bi", "om", "eth", "ane", ",", "which", "suggests", "that", "the", "new", "scheme", "is", "more", "effective", "or", "beneficial", "than", "the", "previous", "one", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "does", "not", "contrad", "ict", "this", "interpretation", ",", "as", "using", "renew", "able", "energy", "sources", "is", "generally", "considered", "a", "positive", "step", "towards", "reducing", "carbon", "foot", "print", "and", "promoting", "sustain", "ability", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9796918034553528, 0.4648553133010864, 0.9999926090240479, 0.6777665019035339, 0.8973298072814941, 0.9713847041130066, 0.9999440908432007, 0.9999841451644897, 0.9978076815605164, 0.8954306244850159, 0.799773633480072, 0.44589242339134216, 0.8892090320587158, 0.9192693829536438, 0.9999992847442627, 0.9999914169311523, 0.9995476603507996, 0.2677083909511566, 0.6301699876785278, 0.8284932971000671, 0.9190294146537781, 0.6329969167709351, 0.4558797776699066, 0.5196404457092285, 0.6370892524719238, 0.9549188613891602, 0.9988263249397278, 0.5634511709213257, 0.5157354474067688, 0.9999567270278931, 0.9997754693031311, 0.9999386072158813, 0.7652933597564697, 0.3362356722354889, 0.6930081844329834, 0.9997614026069641, 0.4448140263557434, 0.914195716381073, 0.9994237422943115, 0.9878688454627991, 0.9893060326576233, 0.9967435598373413, 0.40553537011146545, 0.9778560996055603, 0.9978010058403015, 0.5577746033668518, 0.2699090242385864, 0.30798742175102234, 0.5448997020721436, 0.6027791500091553, 0.27905312180519104, 0.6851678490638733, 0.9999922513961792, 0.8536282181739807, 0.8393017053604126, 0.9999922513961792, 0.9841920137405396, 0.9999794960021973, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9991694688796997, 0.971735417842865, 0.9999953508377075, 0.9999927282333374, 0.9999994039535522, 0.9999995231628418, 0.8826890587806702, 0.812803328037262, 0.273456871509552, 0.7600291967391968, 0.8081862330436707, 0.9715791940689087, 0.9510555863380432, 0.8522160649299622, 0.37897270917892456, 0.9197763800621033, 0.9520601630210876, 0.28710147738456726, 0.6243006587028503, 0.8440919518470764, 0.8473088145256042, 0.9999178647994995, 0.9538478255271912, 0.46114593744277954, 0.5250603556632996, 0.9506909847259521, 0.6469898223876953, 0.9990062117576599, 0.2600068151950836, 0.9999984502792358, 0.907414436340332, 0.6258738040924072, 0.5092503428459167, 0.6198080778121948, 0.45102792978286743, 0.7268829345703125, 0.9999997615814209, 0.9990591406822205, 0.9687869548797607, 0.8629915118217468, 0.6070353984832764, 0.7338598966598511, 0.9340248703956604, 0.9947518706321716, 0.6301853656768799, 0.5810977220535278, 0.44988977909088135, 0.9775437712669373, 0.9121446013450623, 0.9923141598701477, 0.9957992434501648, 0.9893757104873657, 0.9998530149459839, 0.9999994039535522, 0.9863005876541138, 0.7380877137184143]}

This nuance might not be immediately apparent to the user, but understanding the background knowledge can help provide a more accurate and complete analysis.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "term", "'", "ab", "andon", "ed", "'", "generally", "carries", "a", "negative", "con", "notation", ",", "as", "it", "implies", "that", "something", "has", "been", "left", "behind", "or", "for", "s", "aken", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "also", "supports", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "it", "ment", "ions", "that", "leaving", "or", "abandon", "ing", "things", "can", "have", "negative", "consequences", ".", "However", ",", "it", "'", "s", "important", "to", "note", "that", "the", "context", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "in", "the", "text", "can", "sometimes", "change", "its", "meaning", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "the", "text", "states", "that", "'", "ab", "andon", "ed", "areas", "are", "tourist", "attra", "ctions", "'.", "While", "the", "term", "'", "ab", "andon", "ed", "'", "itself", "is", "negative", ",", "the", "context", "suggests", "that", "these", "areas", "have", "been", "rep", "ur", "posed", "and", "now", "offer", "unique", "experiences", "for", "tourists", ".", "This", "nu", "ance", "might", "not", "be", "immediately", "apparent", "to", "the", "user", ",", "but", "understanding", "the", "background", "knowledge", "can", "help", "provide", "a", "more", "accurate", "and", "complete", "analysis", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9266500473022461, 0.5935327410697937, 0.9999887943267822, 0.6562927961349487, 0.9515948295593262, 0.9799762964248657, 0.9999353885650635, 0.9999980926513672, 0.9966468214988708, 0.8239810466766357, 0.6378732323646545, 0.6798291206359863, 0.9719973206520081, 0.9999514818191528, 0.9999622106552124, 0.9999960660934448, 0.9983906745910645, 0.45335376262664795, 0.4904319643974304, 0.9862696528434753, 0.9979332685470581, 0.6021400690078735, 0.9999628067016602, 0.42490869760513306, 0.3886481821537018, 0.8492861986160278, 0.495265394449234, 0.4711756110191345, 0.8597028255462646, 0.5803833603858948, 0.9999203681945801, 0.7665254473686218, 0.7690685391426086, 0.4813348054885864, 0.8339192271232605, 0.9999971389770508, 0.9996243715286255, 0.6093739867210388, 0.48404398560523987, 0.8304333090782166, 0.8457684516906738, 0.33169570565223694, 0.8129138946533203, 0.920842170715332, 0.4345870912075043, 0.7321824431419373, 0.7084243297576904, 0.545373260974884, 0.296804279088974, 1.0, 0.49941712617874146, 0.5896015167236328, 0.8695578575134277, 0.9997469782829285, 0.9999996423721313, 0.5777567625045776, 0.9821382761001587, 0.9343323707580566, 0.9961459636688232, 0.9999128580093384, 0.9971103668212891, 0.23374882340431213, 0.9997304081916809, 0.7064417600631714, 0.7103537321090698, 0.9999986886978149, 0.8112800121307373, 0.9999254941940308, 0.7747098803520203, 0.9936700463294983, 0.6974999308586121, 0.3338884711265564, 0.7496929168701172, 0.9409980177879333, 0.6350538730621338, 0.9992032647132874, 0.5003282427787781, 0.9990849494934082, 0.7187275886535645, 0.2177974134683609, 0.4073105752468109, 0.50913006067276, 0.5267595648765564, 0.9743061065673828, 0.7734280228614807, 0.5117580890655518, 0.9102180600166321, 0.7621867656707764, 0.9999070167541504, 0.7881343364715576, 0.40679189562797546, 0.5304868221282959, 0.9986552000045776, 0.5029708743095398, 0.9856908917427063, 0.9999302625656128, 1.0, 0.998467743396759, 0.8706257343292236, 0.9998830556869507, 0.9999734163284302, 0.9999991655349731, 0.2786921262741089, 0.3598816990852356, 0.5320528149604797, 0.5032692551612854, 0.9556506872177124, 0.9999678134918213, 0.9999339580535889, 0.9999997615814209, 0.9999822378158569, 0.47414419054985046, 0.7345126271247864, 0.9973045587539673, 0.9986410737037659, 0.9592550992965698, 0.3984454274177551, 0.7484321594238281, 0.9636223316192627, 0.9506616592407227, 0.9109048247337341, 0.722501814365387, 0.8973748683929443, 0.5028368234634399, 0.9999954700469971, 0.9997530579566956, 0.8009339570999146, 0.39853572845458984, 0.4725375771522522, 0.7688010931015015, 0.9466383457183838, 0.9825927019119263, 0.85329270362854, 0.790888786315918, 0.3710488975048065, 0.1325768381357193, 0.5551638007164001, 0.37745755910873413, 0.7700026631355286, 0.996641993522644, 0.403905987739563, 0.451427698135376, 0.4570702314376831, 0.9233159422874451, 0.9708735942840576, 0.7786790132522583, 0.7709527611732483, 0.4463264048099518, 0.9215510487556458, 0.6826580166816711, 0.990111768245697, 0.6194065809249878, 0.9058273434638977, 0.2800608277320862, 0.934357762336731, 0.7059065103530884, 0.3250046372413635, 0.7884717583656311, 0.19145506620407104, 0.2953348457813263, 0.9352456331253052, 0.507795512676239]}

The reason for this classification is that the phrase 'beautiful challenge' is often used to describe an experience that is enjoyable, rewarding, and worthwhile, despite its difficulties. The word 'beautiful' implies a sense of positivity and pleasure. The background knowledge does not contradict this interpretation, as it does not suggest that challenges are inherently negative.

The fact that most of the hydrogen will be exported internationally also indicates that this project has the potential to bring economic benefits to Nova Scotia and contribute to the global transition towards clean energy.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "term", "'", "scale", "up", "'", "generally", "refers", "to", "increasing", "the", "size", "or", "production", "of", "a", "project", "or", "business", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "Nova", "Scot", "ia", "'", "s", "plan", "to", "scale", "up", "its", "off", "shore", "wind", "power", "to", "produce", "green", "hydro", "gen", "is", "a", "positive", "action", ".", "The", "production", "of", "green", "hydro", "gen", "from", "renew", "able", "energy", "sources", "is", "a", "significant", "step", "towards", "reducing", "green", "house", "gas", "emissions", "and", "moving", "towards", "a", "more", "sustainable", "energy", "future", ".", "The", "fact", "that", "most", "of", "the", "hydro", "gen", "will", "be", "export", "ed", "internation", "ally", "also", "indicates", "that", "this", "project", "has", "the", "potential", "to", "bring", "economic", "benefits", "to", "Nova", "Scot", "ia", "and", "contribute", "to", "the", "global", "transition", "towards", "clean", "energy", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9733695983886719, 0.4262664318084717, 0.7106067538261414, 0.9769758582115173, 0.9872736930847168, 0.9999821186065674, 0.9986792206764221, 0.3282710313796997, 0.35463953018188477, 0.9999979734420776, 0.5664762258529663, 0.866125226020813, 0.9272239208221436, 0.589377760887146, 0.4109647870063782, 0.3388252258300781, 0.3946724534034729, 0.5336123704910278, 0.6502202749252319, 0.26875072717666626, 0.9106898903846741, 0.8331046104431152, 0.6656549572944641, 0.9171725511550903, 0.9988215565681458, 0.8963324427604675, 0.9999953508377075, 0.9999998807907104, 0.8807547092437744, 0.9999911785125732, 0.6103888154029846, 0.9989847540855408, 0.5815410614013672, 0.9999819993972778, 0.7689720988273621, 0.9965006113052368, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9999977350234985, 0.9998922348022461, 0.6088778376579285, 0.9770205020904541, 0.9998940229415894, 0.9999992847442627, 0.9999996423721313, 0.46586740016937256, 0.7805840373039246, 0.9325156807899475, 0.6560701727867126, 0.2816963791847229, 0.2621884346008301, 0.6843089461326599, 0.9220349788665771, 0.8294693231582642, 0.9939315319061279, 0.9999982118606567, 0.3555484116077423, 0.9330672025680542, 0.9999511241912842, 0.7333046793937683, 0.9362282752990723, 0.5403487682342529, 0.40431225299835205, 0.3750324547290802, 0.9603928327560425, 0.9191004633903503, 0.9720799922943115, 0.3365572988986969, 0.9999979734420776, 0.9939445853233337, 0.999823272228241, 0.8185279965400696, 0.27387961745262146, 0.8361549973487854, 0.7867830991744995, 0.8479217886924744, 0.9991567134857178, 0.8396673202514648, 0.8829712867736816, 0.9533054232597351, 0.31570205092430115, 0.862926185131073, 0.9996377229690552, 0.9686580896377563, 0.9997239708900452, 0.8701673150062561, 0.4261852204799652, 0.9999984502792358, 0.8310222029685974, 0.9999574422836304, 0.9997538924217224, 1.0, 0.9855127930641174, 0.9999994039535522, 0.32237839698791504, 0.28501397371292114, 0.33723556995391846, 0.7968830466270447, 0.6619440317153931, 0.3533312678337097, 0.9167441725730896, 0.9998441934585571, 0.9688726663589478, 0.8495946526527405, 0.9552794694900513, 0.9949445128440857, 0.7297748923301697, 0.9548008441925049, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9999997615814209, 0.5760043859481812, 0.4607935845851898, 0.7768937349319458, 0.5468212366104126, 0.988580048084259, 0.49321699142456055, 0.5710723996162415, 0.6010288596153259, 0.6750731468200684, 0.9670926332473755, 0.32303425669670105]}
