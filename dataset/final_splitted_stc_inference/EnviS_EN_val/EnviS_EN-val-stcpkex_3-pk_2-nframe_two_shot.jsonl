Overall, the negative sentiment associated with the background knowledge and examples supports the classification of 'problems' as negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "pro", "ble", "ms", "'", "is", "classified", "as", "negative", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", "suggest", "that", "problems", "and", "negative", "situations", "are", "generally", "und", "es", "irable", "and", "can", "lead", "to", "negative", "outcomes", ".", "The", "text", "implies", "that", "the", "cost", "of", "living", "crisis", "is", "a", "problem", ",", "and", "the", "comparison", "to", "climate", "change", "suggests", "that", "it", "is", "a", "complex", "and", "potentially", "long", "-", "term", "issue", ".", "The", "immediate", "problems", "of", "hunger", "and", "cold", "are", "more", "easily", "understood", "and", "addressed", ",", "while", "the", "slow", "decline", "of", "medical", "care", "is", "a", "more", "ins", "id", "ious", "and", "difficult", "problem", "to", "tackle", ".", "Overall", ",", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "associated", "with", "the", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", "supports", "the", "classification", "of", "'", "pro", "ble", "ms", "'", "as", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9625005722045898, 0.5212082862854004, 0.504954993724823, 0.9767131805419922, 0.8397274017333984, 0.9999173283576965, 0.9999909996986389, 1.0, 0.9984261989593506, 0.5192211866378784, 0.5874311327934265, 0.9994169473648071, 0.9308859705924988, 0.5076257586479187, 0.44018423557281494, 0.24219855666160583, 0.9266455769538879, 0.37872451543807983, 0.86296147108078, 0.4191284477710724, 0.9955441951751709, 0.8455374240875244, 0.5696728825569153, 0.4716876149177551, 0.4454498291015625, 0.6080076098442078, 0.192954882979393, 0.1911475509405136, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9986564517021179, 0.443111389875412, 0.31164613366127014, 0.7052639126777649, 0.9999966025352478, 0.4865599274635315, 0.5779730677604675, 0.7754048109054565, 0.4158813953399658, 0.3584493100643158, 0.17003367841243744, 0.9944697618484497, 0.523201048374176, 0.7854728102684021, 0.9997778534889221, 0.9999979138374329, 0.9999727010726929, 0.49945399165153503, 0.9558787941932678, 0.7106145620346069, 0.5729698538780212, 0.750687837600708, 0.32078564167022705, 0.15381769835948944, 0.7258902788162231, 0.7795810699462891, 0.9999617338180542, 0.326191246509552, 0.8922728896141052, 0.8278290033340454, 0.5970616936683655, 0.895438015460968, 0.32199999690055847, 0.44436827301979065, 0.40695711970329285, 0.4755462110042572, 0.9994338750839233, 0.9496632218360901, 0.9693753123283386, 0.761185348033905, 0.5004010796546936, 0.2192234843969345, 0.16759014129638672, 0.9339810609817505, 0.9990933537483215, 0.9999707341194153, 0.9997838139533997, 0.6867926716804504, 0.22876493632793427, 0.6177629232406616, 0.9149730205535889, 0.8786484599113464, 0.745308518409729, 0.665289044380188, 0.7512144446372986, 0.9952477812767029, 0.8107510209083557, 0.9791412353515625, 0.9575728178024292, 0.9994345307350159, 0.9999881982803345, 0.6834492683410645, 0.7268203496932983, 0.774063766002655, 0.3764047920703888, 0.9999973177909851, 0.999939501285553, 0.3848389983177185, 0.35212498903274536, 0.39024266600608826, 0.9220713973045349, 0.27498000860214233, 0.9788780212402344, 0.3267737030982971, 0.9999679327011108, 0.9481314420700073, 0.5298388600349426, 0.969597339630127, 0.2634315490722656, 0.999960720539093, 0.6232588887214661, 0.5429793000221252, 0.9654642939567566, 0.868228554725647, 0.9700339436531067, 0.8950468897819519, 0.9729276299476624, 0.9808191657066345, 0.9948124289512634, 0.7831730842590332, 0.9999799132347107, 0.9999978542327881, 1.0, 0.9999939799308777, 0.9997590780258179, 0.9237231016159058, 0.9972426295280457, 0.9804081916809082]}

The presence of the positive term 'organicfood' does not change the polarity of the target phrase, as it is a separate concept.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "with", "'", "in", "the", "text", "'", "a", "ustral", "ian", "food", "is", "grown", "with", "dangerous", "chemicals", "banned", "in", "other", "countries", "the", "country", "has", "some", "of", "the", "most", "la", "x", "regulation", "of", "p", "estic", "ide", "use", "in", "the", "western", "world", "organic", "food", "'", "is", "most", "likely", "to", "have", "a", "negative", "pol", "arity", ".", "The", "reason", "for", "this", "classification", "is", "that", "the", "text", "ment", "ions", "'", "d", "anger", "ous", "chemicals", "'", "and", "'", "l", "ax", "regulation", "',", "which", "are", "negative", "con", "notations", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "also", "supports", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "it", "states", "that", "consum", "ing", "food", "grown", "with", "toxic", "chemicals", "is", "a", "negative", "health", "practice", ".", "The", "presence", "of", "the", "positive", "term", "'", "organ", "ic", "food", "'", "does", "not", "change", "the", "pol", "arity", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", ",", "as", "it", "is", "a", "separate", "concept", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9517945051193237, 0.4070337116718292, 0.4982651472091675, 0.9433473944664001, 0.8959070444107056, 0.9999725818634033, 0.9987545013427734, 0.304729700088501, 0.7311939001083374, 0.3288404941558838, 0.28581178188323975, 0.8749845623970032, 0.9999001026153564, 0.9999996423721313, 0.999993085861206, 0.9999879002571106, 0.9999960660934448, 0.9999238848686218, 0.9998518228530884, 0.9999844431877136, 0.9986101388931274, 0.9999855756759644, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9999812245368958, 0.9563255310058594, 0.9999960064888, 0.9999582767486572, 0.9999875426292419, 0.9999964237213135, 0.9999908208847046, 0.9999786019325256, 0.9999683499336243, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9988136887550354, 0.9999025464057922, 0.9999131560325623, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9999997019767761, 0.999994695186615, 0.9996310472488403, 0.99994295835495, 0.9999855160713196, 0.9999831318855286, 0.9988791942596436, 0.9998396039009094, 0.9959293603897095, 0.3704925775527954, 0.24966542422771454, 0.9922727942466736, 0.47989848256111145, 0.42008328437805176, 0.9719440340995789, 0.9674085974693298, 0.8224747180938721, 0.9999977350234985, 0.6765055060386658, 0.40338265895843506, 0.25363889336586, 0.45740771293640137, 0.9421727657318115, 0.6425590515136719, 0.9157015085220337, 0.8312345743179321, 0.9251565337181091, 0.37400904297828674, 0.14184439182281494, 0.9999997019767761, 0.4528184235095978, 0.9991926550865173, 0.9999942779541016, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9969545006752014, 0.644205629825592, 0.4876902103424072, 0.9807927012443542, 0.9856418371200562, 0.9998705983161926, 0.9853554964065552, 0.3740125000476837, 0.5703549981117249, 0.22704903781414032, 0.3680148720741272, 0.247111514210701, 0.9995543956756592, 0.49605974555015564, 0.4872373640537262, 0.2988474369049072, 0.974392294883728, 0.3820902705192566, 0.7105945944786072, 0.8202624917030334, 0.5443759560585022, 0.5790194272994995, 0.8682365417480469, 0.4886752665042877, 0.31187283992767334, 0.9406866431236267, 0.6296148300170898, 0.9999992251396179, 0.3845544457435608, 0.9916396737098694, 0.9998118877410889, 0.9714670181274414, 0.9977387189865112, 0.9828047752380371, 0.8671767115592957, 0.9889717698097229, 0.996763288974762, 0.9998521208763123, 0.9676146507263184, 0.25174281001091003, 0.23798342049121857, 0.9998903870582581, 0.6948177814483643, 0.3627666234970093, 0.5977733135223389, 0.9974164366722107, 0.9999677538871765, 0.999996542930603, 0.991175651550293, 0.9985966086387634, 0.5735969543457031, 0.9991401433944702, 0.5185332894325256, 0.9811276793479919, 0.4546254575252533, 0.999995231628418, 0.9916935563087463, 0.9040427207946777, 0.4339672923088074, 0.9992622137069702, 0.7000166773796082, 0.8541257977485657, 0.7401891350746155, 0.5935702919960022, 0.2363576591014862, 0.9299935102462769, 0.523059070110321, 0.34510931372642517, 0.7549170851707458]}

In the context of sustainable product design, a lack of increase in costs can be seen as a positive outcome, as it means that the design process is not adding unnecessary financial burden. This is in line with the background knowledge that investing in and consuming eco-friendly products is a positive act. However, it is important to note that the absence of an increase in costs does not necessarily mean a decrease in costs, and it is possible for costs to remain the same while still being a positive outcome. Therefore, the classification of 'no change in costs' as positive is based on the assumption that the costs are not increasing, and that the sustainability of the product design is still a positive outcome.\n\nExplanation:\nThe target phrase 'no change in costs' can be seen as a positive outcome in the context of sustainable product design.

However, the sentiment can also be positive if the action being taken is seen as a positive step towards addressing a problem. In this case, the text does not provide enough context to definitively determine the sentiment, but the overall sentiment of the text is likely to be negative due to the potential for negative consequences if action is not taken on climate change. Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase 'needs to' is negative.\n\nExplanation:\nThe target phrase 'needs to' indicates that there is a necessity or obligation for the state to act on climate change. Given the background knowledge and examples, the sentiment associated with this necessity or obligation is generally negative due to the potential for negative consequences if action is not taken. Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase 'needs to' is negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "ne", "eds", "to", "'", "is", "a", "modal", "verb", "that",

The use of the term 'silly' to dismiss the concern for global warming can be seen as a dismissive and unhelpful response to the issue.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "you", "silly", "'", "is", "an", "expression", "of", "dis", "d", "ain", "or", "mock", "ery", ".", "It", "is", "often", "used", "to", "bel", "ittle", "or", "dismiss", "someone", "'", "s", "opinion", "or", "actions", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "it", "is", "likely", "being", "used", "to", "und", "ermine", "the", "importance", "or", "valid", "ity", "of", "the", "statement", "'", "its", "called", "global", "war", "ming", "'.", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "of", "the", "background", "knowledge", ",", "which", "highlights", "the", "negative", "impact", "of", "human", "activities", "on", "the", "environment", ",", "further", "supports", "the", "classification", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "as", "negative", ".", "The", "use", "of", "the", "term", "'", "s", "illy", "'", "to", "dismiss", "the", "concern", "for", "global", "war", "ming", "can", "be", "seen", "as", "a", "dismiss", "ive", "and", "un", "help", "ful", "response", "to", "the", "issue", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7576645612716675, 0.597551703453064, 0.999999463558197, 0.6045543551445007, 0.8263332843780518, 0.9710001349449158, 0.9998840689659119, 0.9996665120124817, 0.9957716464996338, 0.8635173439979553, 0.7816470861434937, 0.47735610604286194, 0.999584972858429, 0.7877547740936279, 0.9991944432258606, 0.9999670386314392, 0.9976896047592163, 0.48467886447906494, 0.19019310176372528, 0.5748765468597412, 0.9241295456886292, 0.4375556409358978, 0.7447542548179626, 0.9999974966049194, 0.7475077509880066, 0.36849212646484375, 0.9976320266723633, 0.4440343677997589, 0.3967662453651428, 0.27938660979270935, 0.28964269161224365, 0.9929609894752502, 0.7528802752494812, 0.7812812924385071, 0.9996992945671082, 0.7069271802902222, 0.2989341616630554, 0.9299405217170715, 0.8939549326896667, 0.999996542930603, 0.6859897375106812, 0.4855508506298065, 0.5500198602676392, 0.9356996417045593, 0.7019932866096497, 0.5854869484901428, 0.8420107960700989, 0.9998013973236084, 0.8378108739852905, 0.2750720977783203, 0.4508908689022064, 0.4914545714855194, 0.9986043572425842, 0.6179653406143188, 0.2881189286708832, 0.999939501285553, 0.9780759215354919, 0.640716552734375, 0.5114070177078247, 0.7129360437393188, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9352664947509766, 0.4831111431121826, 0.7846311926841736, 0.5626202821731567, 0.9999868273735046, 0.9999883770942688, 0.9999456405639648, 0.9999962449073792, 0.7519621849060059, 0.3671654462814331, 0.4181559979915619, 0.6609039902687073, 0.30212101340293884, 0.9386874437332153, 0.6859375834465027, 0.8590320944786072, 0.357242614030838, 0.5052456855773926, 0.347969114780426, 0.9558713436126709, 0.7642523050308228, 0.9567686319351196, 0.9994508028030396, 0.9995489120483398, 0.972267746925354, 0.9982979893684387, 0.9999989867210388, 0.999992311000824, 0.8967218995094299, 0.3548266589641571, 0.8174648284912109, 0.6342076659202576, 0.939409077167511, 0.972832202911377, 0.5354908108711243, 0.984303891658783, 0.9998527765274048, 0.9997310042381287, 0.9751392602920532, 0.9623258709907532, 0.4433066248893738, 0.4738568961620331, 0.9999957084655762, 0.3368971347808838, 0.4261719882488251, 0.9990989565849304, 0.926127552986145, 0.9997739791870117, 0.9976639151573181, 0.3305807411670685, 0.5618364214897156, 0.45258060097694397, 0.4153538942337036, 0.6870905160903931, 0.9833908677101135, 0.9999635219573975, 0.9999989867210388, 0.7641770839691162, 0.990138590335846, 0.8920431137084961, 0.9999952912330627, 0.7213113307952881, 0.4015490412712097, 0.8420635461807251, 0.5972973704338074, 0.1995127946138382, 0.8339530825614929, 0.9999992251396179, 0.7711181044578552, 0.5245798826217651, 0.8011168837547302, 0.6163552403450012, 0.7126679420471191, 0.9141886234283447]}

The negative sentiment of the background knowledge and examples further supports the classification of 'crisis' as a negative term.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "term", "'", "c", "ris", "is", "'", "is", "often", "used", "to", "describe", "a", "situation", "that", "is", "harmful", "or", "dam", "aging", ",", "causing", "significant", "negative", "consequences", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "text", "ment", "ions", "an", "'", "elect", "ric", "ity", "crisis", "'", "that", "has", "forced", "the", "UK", "government", "to", "borrow", "a", "large", "sum", "of", "money", "to", "subs", "id", "ise", "household", "bills", ".", "This", "situation", "is", "likely", "to", "cause", "financial", "strain", "for", "many", "individuals", "and", "families", ",", "and", "may", "also", "indicate", "larger", "issues", "with", "the", "country", "'", "s", "energy", "infrastructure", "and", "sustain", "ability", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "of", "the", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", "further", "supports", "the", "classification", "of", "'", "c", "ris", "is", "'", "as", "a", "negative", "term", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9143322706222534, 0.6233161687850952, 0.9999925494194031, 0.491642564535141, 0.7475168108940125, 0.9718549847602844, 0.9999229907989502, 0.9999908208847046, 0.9937021136283875, 0.8378368020057678, 0.7531371116638184, 0.36847949028015137, 0.9674599170684814, 0.9208747744560242, 0.9999999403953552, 0.999996542930603, 0.994630753993988, 0.2694006860256195, 0.29692456126213074, 0.5367580056190491, 0.9162972569465637, 0.8762996196746826, 0.5291799902915955, 0.382871150970459, 0.6317944526672363, 0.706768810749054, 0.22706985473632812, 0.5637125968933105, 0.3172776401042938, 0.9999986886978149, 0.4209272861480713, 0.1796448677778244, 0.2668326497077942, 0.23938952386379242, 0.4309981167316437, 0.9386329650878906, 0.7791498303413391, 0.5239254236221313, 0.6781362891197205, 0.9920508861541748, 0.7721249461174011, 0.43219736218452454, 0.3245161771774292, 0.9999999403953552, 0.68067866563797, 0.674433171749115, 0.9998862147331238, 0.9999918341636658, 0.9999987483024597, 0.999946653842926, 0.6774986386299133, 0.412716805934906, 0.7558750510215759, 0.9193699359893799, 0.9984709620475769, 0.6095206141471863, 0.9973913431167603, 0.9995446801185608, 0.9917619228363037, 0.6377766132354736, 0.7740883827209473, 0.8459481596946716, 0.9882935285568237, 0.9999862313270569, 0.8130993843078613, 0.9802056550979614, 0.9999852776527405, 0.5849403142929077, 0.9969976544380188, 0.9982239603996277, 0.4823758900165558, 0.47964924573898315, 0.4491543173789978, 0.48517706990242004, 0.4056962728500366, 0.9143535494804382, 0.4516201615333557, 0.9490386843681335, 0.5759198665618896, 0.4917519688606262, 0.5780092477798462, 0.6288407444953918, 0.9250802993774414, 0.4305899143218994, 0.9176753759384155, 0.3284878432750702, 0.30864831805229187, 0.8324668407440186, 0.33657845854759216, 0.34651798009872437, 0.35662099719047546, 0.7725123763084412, 0.8637031316757202, 0.45377933979034424, 0.999822735786438, 0.9999986290931702, 0.9534688591957092, 0.811845600605011, 0.6371028423309326, 0.6243014931678772, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9561668634414673, 0.4805928170681, 0.6686897873878479, 0.6475204229354858, 0.6382831931114197, 0.9033797383308411, 0.9266676306724548, 0.9476009607315063, 0.6035460829734802, 0.9547870755195618, 0.48085853457450867, 0.568569540977478, 0.5969014763832092, 0.966873288154602, 0.9892464876174927, 0.5538240671157837, 0.9748704433441162, 1.0, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9999974966049194, 0.999940812587738, 0.9333367943763733, 0.9982234239578247, 0.9912062883377075, 0.951716423034668, 0.9889678359031677]}

In this context, the speaker's desire for a ban on plastic bags can be seen as a negative sentiment, as it reflects a need for change due to the perceived harm caused by plastic bags. However, it is important to note that the sentiment of the target phrase itself is not explicitly stated in the text, and the classification is based on the overall sentiment of the text and the background knowledge.\n\nA more positive interpretation could be that the speaker is expressing a desire for a solution to the plastic bag problem, and the ban is seen as a necessary step towards environmental sustainability.

The reason for this classification is that the phrase implies the removal or restriction of certain practices, which can be seen as a negative action when taken in the context of the provided background knowledge. The background knowledge suggests that banning practices is often necessary to protect people from harm and address negative consequences, but it also implies that such actions can be met with resistance and may have negative consequences of their own. In this case, the text expresses a desire to ban outdated practices that cause unwanted pollution and contribute to climate change, which aligns with the sentiment of the background knowledge. However, the negative sentiment is not directly related to the target phrase itself, but rather to the overall context of the text and the background knowledge. The target phrase is negative because it implies the imposition of a restriction or limitation, which can be seen as a negative action in the given context.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The",

However, the negative sentiment of the user's statement is consistent with the sentiment of the background knowledge that criticizing individuals or entities can have a negative sentiment.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "no", "thanks", "'", "is", "classified", "as", "negative", ".", "The", "user", "'", "s", "statement", "express", "es", "a", "ref", "usal", "or", "re", "jection", "towards", "something", ",", "which", "can", "often", "carry", "a", "negative", "sentiment", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "the", "user", "is", "reject", "ing", "something", ",", "but", "the", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", "do", "not", "provide", "enough", "context", "to", "determine", "what", "exactly", "the", "user", "is", "reject", "ing", ".", "However", ",", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "of", "the", "user", "'", "s", "statement", "is", "consistent", "with", "the", "sentiment", "of", "the", "background", "knowledge", "that", "critic", "izing", "individuals", "or", "entities", "can", "have", "a", "negative", "sentiment", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9087786078453064, 0.5393435955047607, 0.6680682897567749, 0.9996523857116699, 0.8370396494865417, 0.9988170266151428, 0.9998970627784729, 0.9967334866523743, 0.2675967514514923, 0.32408905029296875, 0.999691367149353, 0.8086817860603333, 0.6293253898620605, 0.5030806660652161, 0.2236851304769516, 0.6832953095436096, 0.9999735355377197, 0.7901881337165833, 0.3031737506389618, 0.999066948890686, 0.7400739192962646, 0.7731386423110962, 0.9999966025352478, 0.5405582785606384, 0.9048123955726624, 0.9999778270721436, 0.5369681715965271, 0.8741595149040222, 0.7421694993972778, 0.7693182826042175, 0.3282344937324524, 0.2964940071105957, 0.4546695053577423, 0.9548841714859009, 0.9989005327224731, 0.94967120885849, 0.7931877970695496, 0.24635344743728638, 0.8952719569206238, 0.5920060276985168, 0.9991845488548279, 0.729608416557312, 0.7244486808776855, 0.5792438387870789, 0.49381116032600403, 1.0, 0.3063599765300751, 0.3089663088321686, 0.28126657009124756, 0.48735228180885315, 0.30625760555267334, 0.9197499752044678, 0.5617044568061829, 0.8356512784957886, 0.6713191866874695, 0.9999756813049316, 0.9577615261077881, 0.770867109298706, 0.6954853534698486, 0.9171459674835205, 0.6542849540710449, 0.4288941025733948, 0.6746050119400024, 0.3969471752643585, 0.9480811357498169, 0.9952888488769531, 0.6599025130271912, 1.0, 0.7364893555641174, 0.4695452153682709, 0.9999796748161316, 0.44241660833358765, 0.5229038596153259, 0.9783682227134705, 0.30283981561660767, 0.9646607637405396, 0.38991469144821167, 0.9998384118080139, 0.9999814629554749, 0.9712756276130676, 0.8442306518554688, 0.41562867164611816, 0.9999675154685974, 0.8825698494911194, 0.22285744547843933, 0.8775447010993958, 0.7657037973403931, 0.6851314306259155, 0.7764233946800232, 0.32206013798713684, 0.8771405816078186, 0.9909819960594177, 0.8363293409347534, 0.9996997714042664, 0.9999160766601562, 0.9841440916061401, 0.962079644203186, 0.9656861424446106, 0.9999681711196899, 0.9890720844268799, 0.9980276823043823, 0.7750207185745239]}

Instead, it implies opposition or resistance to specific GMOs and corporations. The farmers' stance is not against all GMOs, but rather against those that cause harm to them. Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase 'anti' is neutral.\n\nExplanation:\nThe term 'anti' in the text does not inherently convey a negative sentiment. It simply means 'against' or 'opposed to'. In this context, the farmers are not against all genetically modified organisms (GMOs), but rather against certain ones that pose a threat to them. The farmers' opposition is driven by concerns over cross contamination and financial burden. The sentiment of the text is neutral, as it does not express approval or disapproval of the farmers' stance.

The background knowledge and examples also support this classification, as they suggest that accumulation of unwanted responsibilities or burdens can lead to negative outcomes.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "term", "'", "bur", "den", "'", "in", "the", "context", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "refers", "to", "a", "heavy", "load", "or", "responsibility", "that", "is", "unw", "anted", "or", "difficult", "to", "bear", ".", "In", "the", "provided", "text", ",", "Filip", "ino", "farmers", "are", "stated", "to", "be", "burden", "ed", "by", "GM", "seeds", "they", "cannot", "afford", "to", "plant", "on", "lands", "they", "do", "not", "own", ".", "This", "situation", "is", "likely", "to", "be", "perceived", "as", "negative", ",", "as", "it", "implies", "financial", "strain", "and", "lack", "of", "control", "over", "their", "own", "resources", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", "also", "support", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "they", "suggest", "that", "accum", "ulation", "of", "unw", "anted", "respons", "ibilities", "or", "bur", "d", "ens", "can", "lead", "to", "negative", "outcomes", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.6825188994407654, 0.4958794414997101, 0.9999952912330627, 0.37393584847450256, 0.7705910205841064, 0.9685513377189636, 0.9998727440834045, 0.9999857544898987, 0.993354320526123, 0.8961707949638367, 0.6585637331008911, 0.3477673828601837, 0.9383434653282166, 0.999900758266449, 0.9999948740005493, 0.9980310201644897, 0.17970532178878784, 0.7087811827659607, 0.30907773971557617, 0.9070074558258057, 0.8257305026054382, 0.43008121848106384, 0.9870504140853882, 0.17800484597682953, 0.9998869895935059, 0.40973785519599915, 0.30904316902160645, 0.6700919270515442, 0.8692682385444641, 0.3643980622291565, 0.5754938125610352, 0.5863202214241028, 0.3365459740161896, 0.7540179491043091, 0.592075765132904, 0.5786422491073608, 0.9520650506019592, 0.7691689133644104, 0.9824204444885254, 0.40606066584587097, 0.5889124274253845, 0.630612313747406, 0.9326843619346619, 0.9985319375991821, 0.42452380061149597, 0.9999983906745911, 0.999983549118042, 0.5321195125579834, 0.23221555352210999, 0.9201977849006653, 0.8089853525161743, 0.8411398530006409, 0.9999997019767761, 0.994658350944519, 0.45890146493911743, 0.9974876642227173, 0.7410489320755005, 0.9188269376754761, 0.9998484253883362, 0.6933335065841675, 0.9886335730552673, 0.727273166179657, 0.9970503449440002, 0.9970700740814209, 0.9975911378860474, 0.9999908208847046, 0.999729573726654, 0.9518510699272156, 0.6781366467475891, 0.3269942104816437, 0.2933383882045746, 0.18171903491020203, 0.761010468006134, 0.35034286975860596, 0.24496698379516602, 0.5042684674263, 0.738297164440155, 0.3266617953777313, 0.899910569190979, 0.7473553419113159, 0.48308274149894714, 0.5483084321022034, 0.37739336490631104, 0.6459218263626099, 0.328646183013916, 0.9999877214431763, 0.9254485368728638, 0.727812647819519, 0.7176042199134827, 0.46073517203330994, 0.4253299832344055, 0.8755651116371155, 0.6474761366844177, 0.6767107844352722, 0.974963366985321, 0.43717148900032043, 0.9270655512809753, 0.18493027985095978, 0.5972187519073486, 0.5911937952041626, 0.6046994924545288, 0.9293404221534729, 0.8484365940093994, 0.48515787720680237, 0.20288757979869843, 0.9827297329902649, 0.44211629033088684, 0.9233574867248535, 0.9817790985107422, 0.21147502958774567, 0.9845697283744812, 0.356976181268692, 0.9999505281448364, 0.762677013874054, 0.18942956626415253, 0.9999849200248718, 0.9999969005584717, 0.9339529871940613, 0.499205619096756, 0.9999986290931702, 0.9961264133453369, 0.9957205057144165, 0.6017809510231018, 0.7902359366416931]}

In this context, the phrase 'time to bust out the tote bags' suggests that the speaker is preparing to take out their tote bags for a specific purpose. However, the background knowledge and examples provided suggest that actions that hinder progress towards harmful goals or contribute to negative environmental impacts are typically classified as negative. In this case, the phrase 'bust out' could be interpreted as an action that may be hindering progress towards a positive goal, such as reducing the use of single-use plastics or promoting the use of reusable bags.

The background knowledge and examples provided support this interpretation, as they associate abandonment with negative consequences and outcomes. For instance, leaving or abandoning important things, such as agreements or resources, can have negative consequences. Similarly, activities and places associated with negative outcomes, such as dangerous gambling or bioweapons labs, are to be avoided. The examples also illustrate this point, as they describe oil spills and contaminated coastlines, as well as the need to address climate risk in the financial industry. Overall, the negative sentiment associated with the term 'abandoned' is consistent with the background knowledge and examples provided.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex",

The background knowledge and examples provided do not directly relate to the target phrase, but they can help us understand the sentiment behind it. The first background sentence expresses a negative sentiment towards the excessive cost of certain assets and goods. However, the second background sentence emphasizes the importance of affordable essentials, which is a positive sentiment. The examples also show a negative sentiment towards the potential financial burden of certain actions.\n\nGiven this context, the target phrase 'stop focusing on costs' can be classified as negative because it suggests a reluctance to take action due to financial concerns. However, the underlying message is that there are significant benefits to climate action that should be emphasized instead of the costs. This is a common sentiment in the climate action discourse, as many people want to reduce their carbon footprint but are deterred by the perceived financial burden. The call to action is to shift the focus towards the numerous co-benefits of climate action, which can help overcome this barrier.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "stop",

The background knowledge and examples provided do not alter this interpretation.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "word", "'", "il", "legal", "'", "generally", "carries", "a", "negative", "con", "notation", ",", "as", "it", "implies", "that", "an", "action", "is", "against", "the", "law", "and", "may", "result", "in", "pen", "alties", "or", "consequences", ".", "In", "the", "context", "of", "the", "provided", "text", ",", "the", "word", "'", "il", "legal", "'", "is", "used", "to", "describe", "'", "legal", "name", "fraud", "'", "and", "'", "p", "icking", "up", "trash", "and", "feeding", "birds", "and", "mother", "nature", "'", "s", "creatures", "n", "ong", "mo", "',", "which", "are", "actions", "that", "are", "not", "explicitly", "stated", "as", "being", "against", "the", "law", "but", "could", "potentially", "be", "considered", "as", "such", "depending", "on", "the", "specific", "circumstances", ".", "However", ",", "given", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "associated", "with", "the", "term", "'", "il", "legal", "'", "in", "general", ",", "it", "is", "reasonable", "to", "assume", "that", "the", "speaker", "views", "these", "actions", "as", "negative", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", "provided", "do", "not", "alter", "this", "interpretation", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9339044094085693, 0.5948772430419922, 0.9999973773956299, 0.6274636387825012, 0.8415339589118958, 0.9708206653594971, 0.9999114274978638, 0.9999738931655884, 0.9888073801994324, 0.8089251518249512, 0.7770566344261169, 0.4206356704235077, 0.9679720997810364, 0.999855101108551, 0.999946117401123, 0.9974437355995178, 0.2732870876789093, 0.42134928703308105, 0.9894246459007263, 0.9998064637184143, 0.6237061023712158, 0.9999909996986389, 0.3339788615703583, 0.6203529238700867, 0.9718422889709473, 0.4952622354030609, 0.2809428572654724, 0.7158719301223755, 0.9201558232307434, 0.6702162027359009, 0.4393056035041809, 0.999323308467865, 0.9943339824676514, 0.5363245606422424, 0.35097071528434753, 0.7816318273544312, 0.9999943971633911, 0.5945577025413513, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9108766913414001, 0.626293957233429, 0.935867965221405, 0.4874187111854553, 0.5054258108139038, 0.32974812388420105, 0.8953118324279785, 0.9823988080024719, 0.5721648335456848, 0.942794680595398, 0.9921968579292297, 0.49997299909591675, 0.3437112271785736, 0.6463161706924438, 0.9998477101325989, 0.9986426830291748, 0.999948263168335, 0.6746034026145935, 0.6230481863021851, 0.5409396290779114, 0.9795008301734924, 0.5991480946540833, 0.6597093939781189, 0.5027241706848145, 0.9995617866516113, 0.33512452244758606, 0.9565368890762329, 0.9645646214485168, 0.7112267017364502, 0.9975628852844238, 0.999995768070221, 0.9999173879623413, 0.9789999723434448, 0.9999852180480957, 0.9999573230743408, 0.4652611017227173, 0.996901273727417, 0.9999955892562866, 0.9780692458152771, 0.9999913573265076, 0.9999238848686218, 0.6075713038444519, 0.9971813559532166, 0.9999253153800964, 0.4418974220752716, 0.3476097285747528, 0.37874019145965576, 0.26113441586494446, 0.9705251455307007, 0.5728623270988464, 0.39909741282463074, 0.43145817518234253, 0.6823866963386536, 0.6886076927185059, 0.9586122632026672, 0.4225921630859375, 0.9999909996986389, 0.9999839663505554, 0.7689557671546936, 0.5043364763259888, 0.7220557928085327, 0.9121166467666626, 0.42796170711517334, 0.3965533673763275, 0.7977319359779358, 0.39240455627441406, 0.9999355673789978, 0.9809913039207458, 0.7769252061843872, 0.9555004835128784, 0.9354143738746643, 0.8952027559280396, 0.9999983310699463, 0.48112139105796814, 0.7403777837753296, 0.5673794150352478, 0.8357752561569214, 0.7672268748283386, 0.999988317489624, 0.8368269205093384, 0.5296180248260498, 0.9082646369934082, 0.9962636232376099, 0.9999720454216003, 0.9371762275695801, 0.6940436363220215, 0.7712753415107727, 0.7627975940704346, 0.8420050144195557, 0.8742786645889282, 0.4489099979400635, 0.9999933838844299, 0.557030200958252, 0.9965354204177856, 0.8198069930076599, 0.18449732661247253, 0.6527023911476135, 0.9980127811431885, 0.9829184412956238, 0.7161468863487244, 0.5293359756469727, 0.7516086101531982, 0.3955823481082916, 0.9163774251937866, 0.9831057786941528, 0.6976789236068726, 0.9921939969062805, 0.40813353657722473, 0.8533727526664734, 0.9992597699165344, 0.2657114565372467, 0.9873866438865662, 0.3550330698490143, 0.6890303492546082, 0.923852801322937]}

The background knowledge and examples support this interpretation, as they indicate that neglecting environmental protection and prioritizing personal gain are negative acts.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "phrase", "'", "not", "ge", "ared", "towards", "'", "implies", "a", "lack", "of", "intention", "or", "focus", "towards", "a", "particular", "goal", ",", "which", "is", "often", "associated", "with", "negative", "sentiment", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "text", "states", "that", "the", "lic", "ensing", "application", "process", "is", "not", "ge", "ared", "towards", "protecting", "water", "quality", ".", "This", "suggests", "that", "the", "process", "may", "not", "prior", "itize", "environmental", "sustain", "ability", "or", "reducing", "negative", "impacts", "on", "water", "bodies", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", "support", "this", "interpretation", ",", "as", "they", "indicate", "that", "neglect", "ing", "environmental", "protection", "and", "prior", "it", "izing", "personal", "gain", "are", "negative", "acts", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8462455868721008, 0.6116793155670166, 0.9999934434890747, 0.5353168845176697, 0.8658475279808044, 0.9728246331214905, 0.9998904466629028, 0.9999757409095764, 0.9919424057006836, 0.850645124912262, 0.7933111786842346, 0.47896501421928406, 0.7893990874290466, 0.9995741248130798, 0.9999878406524658, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9994698166847229, 0.996788740158081, 0.2543611526489258, 0.6504770517349243, 0.9805245399475098, 0.9975787401199341, 0.6603568196296692, 0.9130895733833313, 0.44327327609062195, 0.6493985056877136, 0.7898656129837036, 0.6644312143325806, 0.9291513562202454, 0.46263229846954346, 0.7173553705215454, 0.43059882521629333, 0.2997230589389801, 0.38853809237480164, 0.9999769926071167, 0.6893263459205627, 0.7147926092147827, 0.7217501997947693, 0.7097495794296265, 0.8676355481147766, 0.8295484185218811, 0.9996615648269653, 0.722762942314148, 0.3189227879047394, 0.3220069408416748, 0.9983757734298706, 0.9229623675346375, 0.40515297651290894, 0.9999561905860901, 0.9253942966461182, 0.9999775290489197, 0.4869616627693176, 0.615181565284729, 0.9205957055091858, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9998458027839661, 0.9996454119682312, 0.9999830722808838, 0.9999855160713196, 0.5371708869934082, 0.595369815826416, 0.2867182791233063, 0.8909004330635071, 0.9415397047996521, 0.9597699642181396, 0.7517939805984497, 0.41363683342933655, 0.604012131690979, 0.9998349547386169, 0.5148605108261108, 0.6345277428627014, 0.999999463558197, 0.47039714455604553, 0.57588130235672, 0.9915570616722107, 0.990982174873352, 0.9957464933395386, 0.6683889627456665, 0.40076297521591187, 0.514914333820343, 0.39361506700515747, 0.6276269555091858, 0.9881182312965393, 0.6338348984718323, 0.9490544199943542, 0.3356412351131439, 0.9375146627426147, 0.622380256652832, 0.8106711506843567, 0.9290217757225037, 0.3235219419002533, 0.3156167268753052, 0.9963015913963318, 0.44306179881095886, 0.9968131184577942, 0.6795581579208374, 0.4282330274581909, 0.6320369839668274, 0.14274829626083374, 0.9999722242355347, 0.9999801516532898, 0.9721364378929138, 0.9950262308120728, 0.6256880164146423, 0.9597766399383545, 0.8907627463340759, 0.9966748356819153, 0.7077327370643616]}

Therefore, based on the context, it is reasonable to assume that the sentiment of the phrase 'listen to Greta Thunberg' is negative, as it implies following her advice to stop oil and gas exploration and start depending on Russian oil and gas, which is a controversial and potentially harmful solution from an environmental and geopolitical perspective.\n\nExplanation:\nThe target phrase 'listen to' is neutral in itself, but the context in which it is used in the text can provide some clues about its sentiment.

Overall, the absence or lack of something, as expressed by the target phrase, tends to have a negative connotation.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "no", "such", "thing", "'", "express", "es", "a", "lack", "or", "absence", "of", "something", ",", "which", "can", "often", "convey", "a", "negative", "sentiment", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "the", "phrase", "suggests", "that", "there", "is", "no", "viable", "solution", "or", "alternative", "to", "the", "problem", "at", "hand", ",", "which", "can", "be", "perceived", "as", "disappoint", "ing", "or", "frustr", "ating", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", "also", "support", "this", "interpretation", ",", "as", "they", "contain", "negative", "sent", "iments", "related", "to", "threats", ",", "cont", "amination", ",", "ins", "an", "ity", ",", "and", "lack", "of", "trans", "parency", ".", "Overall", ",", "the", "absence", "or", "lack", "of", "something", ",", "as", "expressed", "by", "the", "target", "phrase", ",", "tends", "to", "have", "a", "negative", "con", "notation", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9217193722724915, 0.5075581073760986, 0.9999978542327881, 0.3970734477043152, 0.8764046430587769, 0.965921938419342, 0.999934732913971, 0.9999833703041077, 0.9961113929748535, 0.8848380446434021, 0.8395075798034668, 0.4683448076248169, 0.9998040199279785, 0.7228912711143494, 0.9996808767318726, 0.999998152256012, 0.9999859929084778, 0.9963502287864685, 0.27014341950416565, 0.9998297691345215, 0.567343533039093, 0.8038739562034607, 0.957927942276001, 0.6306676864624023, 0.5649330615997314, 0.9572471976280212, 0.5937139987945557, 0.7604953050613403, 0.4315103590488434, 0.5319908261299133, 0.3205370008945465, 0.7783443927764893, 0.6471058130264282, 0.9698044061660767, 0.7058573365211487, 0.5914807915687561, 0.8611459136009216, 0.49454566836357117, 0.9997084140777588, 0.8024992346763611, 0.15404123067855835, 0.3246951997280121, 0.9483885169029236, 0.6014799475669861, 0.8084979057312012, 0.503571093082428, 0.6038966178894043, 0.7579585909843445, 0.7444378137588501, 0.5034750699996948, 0.8594092726707458, 0.6425756216049194, 0.7528983354568481, 0.4397422969341278, 0.9999960660934448, 0.4317757189273834, 0.7496582865715027, 0.4116585850715637, 0.787790060043335, 0.3999067544937134, 0.9979884028434753, 0.55446857213974, 0.9999982118606567, 0.9455145001411438, 0.8062693476676941, 0.999999463558197, 0.9491277933120728, 0.6165935397148132, 0.784349799156189, 0.9544460773468018, 0.31085512042045593, 0.9864973425865173, 0.3293725550174713, 0.4119099974632263, 0.5951444506645203, 0.495104044675827, 0.7936084270477295, 0.8227440118789673, 0.9007706046104431, 0.17165346443653107, 0.5401803255081177, 0.6819896101951599, 0.9999979138374329, 0.3762984871864319, 0.9999969005584717, 0.278435617685318, 0.9415363073348999, 0.6209455728530884, 0.9993652105331421, 0.999850332736969, 0.47266680002212524, 0.9999973177909851, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9990207552909851, 0.9795420169830322, 0.3388221263885498, 0.9920477867126465, 0.4297345280647278, 0.9999991655349731, 0.8583551049232483, 0.24215172231197357, 0.999995768070221, 0.9914512038230896, 0.4212806820869446, 0.6599206924438477, 0.8823341131210327, 0.35712486505508423, 0.863139808177948, 0.3518744707107544, 0.9510241150856018, 0.43377554416656494, 0.5200142860412598, 0.9509811997413635, 0.9962316751480103, 0.9999004602432251, 0.9704636931419373, 0.308843195438385, 0.9999643564224243, 0.5022544860839844, 0.9992716908454895, 0.9852607846260071, 0.9940028190612793, 0.9999828934669495, 0.8220446705818176, 0.9874590039253235]}

These positive sentiments do not change the overall negative polarity of the target phrase, as the negative sentiment is the dominant one in the given context.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "car", "bon", "tax", "makes", "no", "sense", "'", "is", "a", "negative", "statement", ",", "as", "it", "implies", "that", "the", "carbon", "tax", "is", "an", "irr", "ational", "or", "un", "just", "ified", "idea", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "supports", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "negative", "statements", "are", "used", "to", "label", "ideas", "or", "actions", "as", "absurd", "or", "un", "reason", "able", ".", "The", "user", "'", "s", "statement", "also", "ment", "ions", "that", "the", "carbon", "tax", "has", "a", "zero", "effect", "on", "climate", "change", ",", "which", "further", "rein", "for", "ces", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "carbon", "tax", ".", "However", ",", "the", "user", "also", "suggests", "that", "the", "carbon", "tax", "could", "be", "used", "for", "something", "useful", ",", "such", "as", "natural", "dis", "asters", ",", "and", "that", "everyone", "has", "the", "right", "to", "have", "clean", "air", ".", "These", "positive", "sent", "iments", "do", "not", "change", "the", "overall", "negative", "pol", "arity", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", ",", "as", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "is", "the", "dominant", "one", "in", "the", "given", "context", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8712129592895508, 0.5964581966400146, 0.9999961853027344, 0.5518726110458374, 0.9242939352989197, 0.9687231183052063, 0.999898374080658, 0.9999770522117615, 0.9913040995597839, 0.7789053916931152, 0.8052863478660583, 0.5934858918190002, 0.9997475147247314, 0.6028861403465271, 0.9869683384895325, 0.999999463558197, 0.9999922513961792, 0.9999638199806213, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9999986290931702, 0.9995397925376892, 0.4875475764274597, 0.9363535046577454, 0.9036469459533691, 0.9927303194999695, 0.3118390142917633, 0.6861134171485901, 0.6636469960212708, 0.45340824127197266, 0.8872244954109192, 0.915665864944458, 0.5912571549415588, 0.9999976754188538, 0.9464832544326782, 0.40285971760749817, 0.4945712089538574, 0.9999842643737793, 0.7663936614990234, 0.2694094479084015, 0.460768461227417, 0.7575719356536865, 0.30375492572784424, 0.6674027442932129, 0.5192950367927551, 0.32822006940841675, 0.9642461538314819, 0.2916184067726135, 0.9854903221130371, 0.812852144241333, 0.600413978099823, 0.9064298272132874, 0.32134512066841125, 0.8282619118690491, 0.41610777378082275, 0.7247475385665894, 0.9811117053031921, 0.7866182327270508, 0.495938241481781, 0.904445469379425, 0.9764328598976135, 0.9994975328445435, 0.5794241428375244, 0.5891784429550171, 0.9839299321174622, 0.9991393089294434, 0.9999976754188538, 0.9459158778190613, 0.5174749493598938, 0.27956268191337585, 0.5508860349655151, 0.9999865889549255, 0.30448246002197266, 0.546367347240448, 0.310493528842926, 0.9999997019767761, 0.4002832770347595, 0.6506829261779785, 0.9863202571868896, 0.9958850741386414, 0.9232869744300842, 0.4480055570602417, 0.6636394262313843, 0.9999049305915833, 0.9998966455459595, 0.9889240264892578, 0.9999868869781494, 0.8431498408317566, 0.5234376788139343, 0.596813440322876, 0.6219807267189026, 0.9999976754188538, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9400215744972229, 0.9834410548210144, 0.9942116141319275, 0.88535475730896, 0.8487799167633057, 0.553432047367096, 0.9999977350234985, 0.9943527579307556, 0.5893834829330444, 0.9999865889549255, 0.5564324259757996, 0.9715355634689331, 0.8560627102851868, 0.7808555364608765, 0.8762142062187195, 0.9975427985191345, 0.7570356130599976, 0.9999960660934448, 0.9288869500160217, 0.9993214011192322, 0.9937830567359924, 0.9956099987030029, 0.442991703748703, 0.9852319955825806, 0.8575412034988403, 0.6926881670951843, 0.9999918341636658, 0.5653273463249207, 0.9996376037597656, 0.9999991655349731, 0.6441410183906555, 0.5144957900047302, 0.3858681321144104, 0.6660727858543396, 0.645680844783783, 0.9951183199882507, 0.9999839663505554, 0.9999961853027344, 0.5095857381820679, 0.999993085861206, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9560196399688721, 0.6960086822509766, 0.4500868618488312, 0.7279754281044006, 0.999998152256012, 0.4004959166049957, 0.9999477863311768, 0.5063216090202332, 0.9996709227561951, 0.9296525120735168, 0.9539424180984497, 0.8107892274856567, 0.9999987483024597, 0.996427595615387, 0.9997731447219849, 0.9804599285125732, 0.9998695254325867, 0.5235410332679749, 0.5793077945709229, 0.6444624662399292, 0.5515645742416382, 0.9469898343086243, 0.7656608819961548, 0.8634157776832581, 0.7463623285293579, 0.8326137661933899, 0.8817006945610046, 0.9790312051773071, 0.49752500653266907, 0.672615110874176, 0.9998225569725037, 0.965089738368988]}

Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase 'largest exporter' in this context is negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "term", "'", "larg", "est", "ex", "porter", "'", "is", "generally", "considered", "neutral", "as", "it", "does", "not", "inher", "ently", "convey", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", ".", "However", ",", "in", "the", "context", "of", "the", "provided", "text", ",", "the", "sentiment", "associated", "with", "being", "the", "'", "larg", "est", "ex", "porter", "'", "is", "likely", "to", "be", "negative", "due", "to", "the", "background", "knowledge", "that", "large", "entities", "can", "cause", "significant", "harm", "and", "negative", "consequences", ".", "Additionally", ",", "the", "text", "ment", "ions", "that", "Russia", "is", "the", "'", "world", "'", "s", "largest", "ex", "porter", "of", "nuclear", "plants", ",'", "which", "could", "be", "perceived", "as", "a", "negative", "situation", "due", "to", "the", "potential", "risks", "and", "negative", "consequences", "associated", "with", "nuclear", "energy", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "pol", "arity", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "'", "larg", "est", "ex", "porter", "'", "in", "this", "context", "is", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.972242534160614, 0.5850780606269836, 0.4623873829841614, 0.9822290539741516, 0.9983653426170349, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9999500513076782, 0.999958336353302, 0.9998387098312378, 0.31715360283851624, 0.5129030346870422, 0.621025800704956, 0.5013976693153381, 0.31321728229522705, 0.9849491715431213, 0.24898548424243927, 0.9994087219238281, 0.739626944065094, 0.9999879002571106, 0.4882272183895111, 0.5183310508728027, 0.9997949600219727, 0.9999575018882751, 0.8711280226707458, 0.9431013464927673, 0.9735193252563477, 0.9999902844429016, 0.28519150614738464, 0.6558371782302856, 0.6158506274223328, 0.8103521466255188, 0.8712244629859924, 0.5248186588287354, 0.7104823589324951, 0.7843019962310791, 0.5070013403892517, 0.3082696497440338, 0.30445587635040283, 0.9990013241767883, 0.7511844635009766, 0.669883131980896, 0.6812600493431091, 0.7409627437591553, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9993433952331543, 0.9999821186065674, 0.9769467115402222, 0.5117347836494446, 0.31705763936042786, 0.7400241494178772, 0.9541184306144714, 0.9754323959350586, 0.670001208782196, 0.9996535181999207, 0.9665095210075378, 0.2748226523399353, 0.8554229140281677, 0.28845924139022827, 0.5665884613990784, 0.9981645941734314, 0.42982351779937744, 0.9142885208129883, 0.94280606508255, 0.9923416376113892, 0.9612042307853699, 0.9814743995666504, 0.999974250793457, 0.7599192261695862, 0.19402624666690826, 0.999994695186615, 0.8120614886283875, 0.33892887830734253, 0.591301441192627, 0.9999996423721313, 0.5173247456550598, 0.3985288441181183, 0.7763250470161438, 0.8866181969642639, 0.7329356074333191, 0.9152844548225403, 0.9866079092025757, 0.9999855756759644, 0.9998970031738281, 0.9986874461174011, 0.9999902844429016, 0.8497118353843689, 0.999995231628418, 0.9998674392700195, 0.48721790313720703, 0.6084611415863037, 0.29499906301498413, 0.3645080029964447, 0.5361891388893127, 0.8873546719551086, 0.7753427624702454, 0.7808057069778442, 0.9280867576599121, 0.4566551744937897, 0.9997530579566956, 0.7913430333137512, 0.9257296323776245, 0.8311536908149719, 0.7335245609283447, 0.7025344371795654, 0.6722593903541565, 0.9388564825057983, 0.9999899864196777, 0.9887644648551941, 0.7125760316848755, 0.8968436121940613, 0.6196034550666809, 0.9999938607215881, 0.5684190988540649, 0.39943385124206543, 0.9999966025352478, 0.7078698873519897, 0.8013909459114075, 0.80946284532547, 0.9998253583908081, 0.9413646459579468, 0.9990516901016235, 1.0, 0.9999908208847046, 0.9996909499168396, 0.9992640018463135, 0.5269994139671326, 0.6982457637786865, 0.9635072946548462, 0.638282299041748, 0.36881449818611145, 0.9772977232933044, 0.4509035050868988]}
