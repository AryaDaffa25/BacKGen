The phrase 'has not been destroyed' implies that the green areas have been harmed or damaged, and the phrase 'turned into a parking lot' suggests that these areas have been replaced with structures that are not conducive to natural growth or human enjoyment. The phrase 'people probably ca nt even step on there without having to cross a highway' further emphasizes the inaccessibility and potential danger of these areas, which can be seen as a negative development.

This is a violation or breach of rules and regulations, which is typically viewed as undesirable or harmful. In this context, the US court ruling that QR codes in lieu of GMO labeling are unlawful suggests that the use of QR codes as a substitute for clear and accessible labeling information is not acceptable under the law. This can be problematic for consumers who may have dietary restrictions or allergies and need to be able to easily identify genetically modified organisms in their food.

In the context of food, artificial flavors and colors are often viewed as unhealthy and potentially harmful.

However, in the given text, the speaker expresses frustration with a customer service policy that only allows them to complain about one issue a day. The use of the word 'strangest' in this context implies an unusual and negative situation. Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase 'strangest' is negative.\n\nExplanation:\nThe word 'strangest' in the text is used to describe a customer service policy that only allows individuals to complain about one issue a day. Given the speaker's frustration with this policy, it is clear that the use of the word 'strangest' is meant to convey a negative sentiment. The policy is unusual and restrictive, and the speaker is unhappy with it. The background knowledge and examples provided do not directly relate to the target phrase, but they can help illustrate the general meaning of the word 'strangest' and how it can convey a negative sentiment in certain contexts.

In this context, the farmers' opposition to specific GMOs owned by corporations is driven by concerns over cross contamination and dependency on expensive seeds.

The sentence mentions 'problems' and 'hard to see farther away stuff in space' due to the brightness of SpaceX satellites. SpaceX's claim of using a darker solar panel is not explicitly stated to be true, and the sentence implies that astronomers are having difficulty with this issue. Therefore, the overall sentiment of the sentence is negative, and the use of the word 'claims' in this context can be classified as negative as well.\n\nExplanation:\nThe text expresses that astronomers are facing difficulties with SpaceX satellites due to their brightness, making it hard for them to see farther away objects in space. The sentence also mentions that SpaceX claims to have used a darker solar panel, but the truth of this claim is not explicitly stated.

In the context of the provided text, it suggests that recycling and waste management should have a greater importance or emphasis compared to climate change. The background knowledge does not provide any information directly related to the target phrase. However, the negative sentiment in the first and second background sentences indicates a concern or issue with certain practices or trends.

The background knowledge and examples also support a negative sentiment towards the damaging effects of insensitive and dismissive behavior towards important issues, such as climate change and economic policies.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "word", "'", "tr", "ashing", "'", "implies", "dam", "aging", "or", "critic", "izing", "something", "in", "a", "harsh", "or", "destruct", "ive", "way", ".", "In", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", ",", "it", "is", "clear", "that", "the", "speaker", "is", "express", "ing", "their", "dis", "appro", "val", "and", "frustration", "towards", "Liz", "Tr", "uss", "'", "s", "policies", ",", "particularly", "her", "decision", "to", "lift", "the", "fr", "acking", "ban", "and", "her", "support", "for", "a", "trick", "le", "-", "down", "economy", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "these", "policies", "is", "further", "emphas", "ized", "by", "the", "speaker", "'", "s", "expression", "of", "a", "need", "for", "Bor", "is", "Johnson", "'", "s", "'", "command", "ing", "voice", "'", "to", "address", "the", "situation", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", "also", "support", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "dam", "aging", "effects", "of", "ins", "ensitive", "and", "dismiss", "ive", "behavior", "towards", "important", "issues", ",", "such", "as", "climate", "change", "and", "economic", "policies", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8850134611129761, 0.5716079473495483, 0.999997079372406, 0.5068523287773132, 0.8100898265838623, 0.9749298095703125, 0.9999162554740906, 0.9999851584434509, 0.9969788789749146, 0.8014410734176636, 0.7559411525726318, 0.5144033432006836, 0.9582194685935974, 0.9992443323135376, 0.9998511672019958, 0.9986475110054016, 0.1918085664510727, 0.3124101758003235, 0.9999761581420898, 0.5603687763214111, 0.712040901184082, 0.9752117395401001, 0.5018115043640137, 0.4267204701900482, 0.9927992820739746, 0.7253987789154053, 0.42055198550224304, 0.5720804333686829, 0.9999992251396179, 0.6162542104721069, 0.9601353406906128, 0.42514869570732117, 0.6765130162239075, 0.5691004395484924, 0.9071229100227356, 0.9732642769813538, 0.3401266038417816, 0.9904603958129883, 0.6092941761016846, 0.44379690289497375, 0.6898059844970703, 0.9941743016242981, 0.9288529753684998, 0.9210232496261597, 0.8558674454689026, 0.8432562351226807, 0.9999989867210388, 0.32341915369033813, 0.395447701215744, 0.9379722476005554, 0.9999948740005493, 0.41303884983062744, 0.3187165856361389, 0.8366936445236206, 0.6463156938552856, 0.999991238117218, 0.9999990463256836, 0.8759358525276184, 0.6704947352409363, 0.7106032371520996, 0.5277966260910034, 0.44472429156303406, 0.7683131694793701, 0.5456226468086243, 0.9990325570106506, 0.9995658993721008, 0.9998248219490051, 0.9994754791259766, 0.999992311000824, 0.9999822378158569, 0.9968476295471191, 0.420465886592865, 0.42443445324897766, 0.9805410504341125, 0.5841448903083801, 0.9959298968315125, 0.9999620318412781, 0.9918481707572937, 0.9999870657920837, 0.999502956867218, 0.9876691102981567, 0.7380131483078003, 0.34423333406448364, 0.9558799266815186, 0.5297346711158752, 0.5909443497657776, 0.9924588203430176, 0.9139514565467834, 0.4058503806591034, 0.6320106983184814, 0.9996094703674316, 0.935588538646698, 0.9592920541763306, 0.5977912545204163, 0.9997223615646362, 0.9999983310699463, 0.17870301008224487, 0.8045448064804077, 0.5870375633239746, 0.5566732287406921, 0.9233150482177734, 0.9286003112792969, 0.9999999403953552, 0.8605459332466125, 0.9987449049949646, 0.9999987483024597, 0.4683271050453186, 0.9598791003227234, 1.0, 0.9999486207962036, 0.6978421211242676, 0.46914011240005493, 0.4386768937110901, 0.7728511691093445, 0.8542492985725403, 0.9813347458839417, 0.3651092052459717, 0.8048380017280579, 0.9714668989181519, 0.5428615808486938, 0.9460471272468567, 0.3476208746433258, 0.49132871627807617, 0.5481358170509338, 0.9986230731010437, 0.5175313949584961, 0.9286782741546631, 0.24549008905887604, 0.33923473954200745, 0.9999996423721313, 0.5724352598190308, 0.990792453289032, 0.46570032835006714, 0.889616072177887, 0.6532520055770874, 0.9628294110298157, 1.0, 0.9214370846748352, 0.9370068311691284, 0.9794356822967529, 0.9657298922538757, 0.5672730207443237, 0.6489123702049255, 0.9999765157699585, 0.6365700364112854, 0.9997361898422241, 0.9395197629928589, 0.6454259157180786, 0.8270568251609802, 0.8895528316497803, 0.4495081305503845]}

The background knowledge and examples also support this classification, as they highlight negative consequences of progress, such as environmental damage and international political challenges.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", ".", "The", "phrase", "'", "at", "the", "expense", "'", "implies", "a", "loss", "or", "sacrifice", ",", "which", "is", "typically", "associated", "with", "a", "negative", "sentiment", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "text", "suggests", "that", "rapid", "progress", "towards", "low", "carbon", "transitions", "cannot", "be", "made", "without", "considering", "social", "justice", ",", "indicating", "that", "there", "may", "be", "a", "potential", "cost", "or", "loss", "to", "certain", "groups", "or", "aspects", "of", "society", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", "also", "support", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "they", "highlight", "negative", "consequences", "of", "progress", ",", "such", "as", "environmental", "damage", "and", "international", "political", "challenges", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9154144525527954, 0.5570054650306702, 0.9999987483024597, 0.4503241777420044, 0.57477205991745, 0.5508878231048584, 0.7274518609046936, 0.9993685483932495, 0.9999978542327881, 0.9999716877937317, 0.9278102517127991, 0.4588189721107483, 0.5333806276321411, 0.524958610534668, 0.8045090436935425, 0.6132218241691589, 0.6736325025558472, 0.3852131962776184, 0.4194447696208954, 0.33885082602500916, 0.3884904980659485, 0.9999901056289673, 0.6330054998397827, 0.999699592590332, 0.9866561889648438, 0.9763407707214355, 0.47822773456573486, 0.6153587698936462, 0.8363876342773438, 0.9994268417358398, 0.562015950679779, 0.26863181591033936, 0.47528329491615295, 0.9990972280502319, 0.368619441986084, 0.998159646987915, 0.5842998027801514, 0.2603161036968231, 0.7273563742637634, 0.991176187992096, 0.9325650930404663, 0.6175098419189453, 0.6835919618606567, 0.749434769153595, 0.24686528742313385, 0.9323738217353821, 0.9999925494194031, 0.8499829173088074, 0.5314270853996277, 0.6567615866661072, 0.3261508643627167, 0.678025484085083, 0.9976195096969604, 0.3084665536880493, 0.37225040793418884, 0.5821889042854309, 0.9707682132720947, 0.4921923577785492, 0.444140762090683, 0.5981248021125793, 0.37072494626045227, 0.7920840382575989, 0.3976188600063324, 0.9972475171089172, 0.999841034412384, 0.9916540384292603, 0.38122159242630005, 0.5201793313026428, 0.9706514477729797, 0.7827175259590149, 0.9895071387290955, 0.31780266761779785, 0.30840179324150085, 0.5486356019973755, 0.4670622944831848, 0.8889407515525818, 0.8340617418289185, 0.9907441735267639, 0.31974583864212036, 0.5780656933784485, 0.7077435255050659, 0.6569840312004089, 0.3648201823234558, 0.5903581380844116, 0.9877902269363403, 0.9999377727508545, 0.6131450533866882, 0.7890943884849548, 0.8675010204315186, 0.37454307079315186, 0.5106157064437866, 0.8086580038070679, 0.9288850426673889, 0.9432358145713806]}

In this context, it suggests that the idea or concept being referred to is not valid or real. The negative sentiment in the background knowledge, such as the negative development of blue-green algae bloom, may influence the overall polarity of the text.
