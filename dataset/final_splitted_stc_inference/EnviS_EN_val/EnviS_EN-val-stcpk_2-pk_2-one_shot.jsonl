However, the sentiment subjectivity classification would be negative if the text suggested that regulation is an unnecessary burden or hindrance, as per the first sentiment stereotype provided in the background knowledge.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "is", "'", "neut", "ral", "'.", "While", "the", "word", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "itself", "is", "neutral", ",", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", "suggests", "that", "the", "regulation", "of", "agricultural", "chemicals", "is", "a", "necessary", "action", "to", "prevent", "harm", "to", "the", "environment", "and", "public", "health", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "in", "this", "context", "is", "neutral", "as", "it", "is", "a", "des", "irable", "action", "with", "positive", "implications", "for", "the", "environment", "and", "public", "health", ".", "However", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "classification", "would", "be", "negative", "if", "the", "text", "suggested", "that", "regulation", "is", "an", "unnecessary", "burden", "or", "hind", "r", "ance", ",", "as", "per", "the", "first", "sentiment", "stere", "otype", "provided", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8509953618049622, 0.7687525153160095, 0.9232088327407837, 0.862116813659668, 0.9999659061431885, 0.6339915990829468, 0.9646909236907959, 0.5146858096122742, 0.9997760653495789, 0.7140365242958069, 0.9995236396789551, 0.9999773502349854, 0.9984269142150879, 0.6182417273521423, 0.6934173107147217, 0.6779624223709106, 0.9999943971633911, 0.5148950815200806, 0.32714375853538513, 0.6106430888175964, 0.18863727152347565, 0.9581380486488342, 0.9999728202819824, 0.9994957447052002, 0.9998836517333984, 0.7125393748283386, 0.6232602596282959, 0.471163272857666, 0.9105236530303955, 0.8641524910926819, 0.42212480306625366, 0.5528953075408936, 0.9529855847358704, 0.6964067816734314, 0.32150354981422424, 0.6392890214920044, 0.7114440202713013, 0.739096999168396, 0.435525506734848, 0.9957633018493652, 0.9999762773513794, 0.6471220850944519, 0.6346683502197266, 0.6897428035736084, 0.4113754332065582, 0.7613021731376648, 0.4511811137199402, 0.9199132323265076, 0.9841089844703674, 0.996476948261261, 0.999922513961792, 0.7806522846221924, 0.3498292863368988, 0.9999468326568604, 0.49646323919296265, 0.7280399799346924, 0.9999003410339355, 0.9209375381469727, 0.835372269153595, 0.7739410996437073, 0.9999902248382568, 0.4955442547798157, 0.7990478277206421, 0.61951744556427, 0.9995294809341431, 0.9079321026802063, 0.9984122514724731, 0.9994332194328308, 0.9813970327377319, 0.5273449420928955, 0.9353653192520142, 0.8372566103935242, 0.6816226243972778, 0.5997620820999146, 0.49682289361953735, 0.715686023235321, 0.4440103769302368, 0.381071001291275, 0.26204249262809753, 0.9995667338371277, 0.7324913144111633, 0.27606940269470215, 0.7232035398483276, 0.2588125765323639, 0.5285978317260742, 0.8620593547821045, 0.9505590796470642, 0.9659192562103271, 0.9938136339187622, 0.9920738935470581, 0.8896064162254333, 0.43477752804756165, 0.9999897480010986, 0.5315936207771301, 0.575233519077301, 0.5718647837638855, 0.9999960660934448, 0.47215452790260315, 0.35779884457588196, 0.6802677512168884, 0.7620312571525574, 0.7640331387519836, 0.9774088859558105, 0.4614425301551819, 0.2579706013202667, 0.7074303030967712, 0.28751689195632935, 0.5017160177230835, 0.5484215617179871, 0.6873321533203125, 0.7772964239120483, 0.9120213985443115, 0.3695652484893799, 0.9874271154403687, 0.9993979930877686, 0.5187462568283081, 0.8423258066177368, 0.7991295456886292, 0.5335583090782166, 0.6080702543258667, 0.8231296539306641, 0.9890649318695068, 0.9999899864196777, 0.9155417084693909, 0.6750765442848206, 0.9998975992202759, 0.9998753070831299, 0.9999922513961792, 0.9999425411224365, 0.9198106527328491]}

However, the sentiment phrase 'needs to' itself is neutral and does not add to or detract from the positive sentiment expressed in the text.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "ne", "eds", "to", "'", "is", "'", "neut", "ral", "'.", "The", "phrase", "'", "ne", "eds", "to", "'", "is", "a", "modal", "verb", "that", "express", "es", "necessity", "or", "obligation", ",", "and", "it", "does", "not", "inher", "ently", "convey", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "classification", "depends", "on", "the", "context", "of", "the", "sentence", "and", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "s", "relationship", "to", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "expressed", "in", "the", "text", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "the", "text", "'", "s", "sentiment", "is", "positive", ",", "as", "it", "emphas", "izes", "the", "importance", "of", "addressing", "climate", "change", "and", "making", "it", "a", "campaign", "issue", ".", "However", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "ne", "eds", "to", "'", "itself", "is", "neutral", "and", "does", "not", "add", "to", "or", "det", "ract", "from", "the", "positive", "sentiment", "expressed", "in", "the", "text", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9042951464653015, 0.7084938287734985, 0.8424661159515381, 0.8095037341117859, 0.9999816417694092, 0.6769510507583618, 0.9182083010673523, 0.5986232757568359, 0.9931936860084534, 0.999721109867096, 0.7405223250389099, 0.9998329877853394, 0.9999997615814209, 0.9999934434890747, 0.9990634322166443, 0.9056845307350159, 0.3909541964530945, 0.6436527371406555, 0.9999904632568359, 0.5056651830673218, 0.45221665501594543, 0.4415079951286316, 0.5530236959457397, 0.9996304512023926, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9999265670776367, 0.9953823685646057, 0.38112324476242065, 0.2989480495452881, 0.2885972261428833, 0.9554804563522339, 0.3611029386520386, 0.24336379766464233, 0.9998270869255066, 0.478098064661026, 0.5509960651397705, 0.8191824555397034, 0.5682750940322876, 0.5382055044174194, 0.7731353044509888, 0.73375403881073, 0.9999262094497681, 0.3011520802974701, 0.9999794960021973, 0.5112532377243042, 0.7510573863983154, 0.9998676776885986, 0.9999798536300659, 0.6160418391227722, 0.9034724235534668, 0.4857119619846344, 0.4432940185070038, 0.46278905868530273, 0.9997902512550354, 0.39603349566459656, 0.6242914795875549, 0.9872654676437378, 0.9992809891700745, 0.8697943687438965, 0.32470402121543884, 0.9963674545288086, 0.24446813762187958, 0.5430448055267334, 0.9824503660202026, 0.864984929561615, 0.8340568542480469, 0.516508936882019, 0.9999468326568604, 0.5815919041633606, 0.9092646837234497, 0.6248149871826172, 0.3797932267189026, 0.6750759482383728, 0.62550950050354, 0.8508154153823853, 0.9998571872711182, 0.9949616193771362, 0.9523398280143738, 0.7723879814147949, 0.8547472953796387, 0.7628084421157837, 0.999993085861206, 0.8771010041236877, 0.42896556854248047, 0.2724708914756775, 0.9999880790710449, 0.917413592338562, 0.9328869581222534, 0.38497695326805115, 0.485186904668808, 0.6432753205299377, 0.8951122760772705, 0.36138060688972473, 0.9999340772628784, 0.9786060452461243, 0.8462847471237183, 0.8975122570991516, 0.40388965606689453, 0.9888181090354919, 0.9999749660491943, 0.4592269957065582, 0.9837729334831238, 0.9997714161872864, 0.9932810664176941, 0.4843117892742157, 0.9996009469032288, 0.9189059734344482, 0.825510561466217, 0.9999957084655762, 0.9592072367668152, 0.7042544484138489, 0.976244330406189, 0.8105717897415161, 0.9999409914016724, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9999048709869385, 0.9985744953155518, 0.7926575541496277, 0.7057258486747742, 0.9310891032218933, 0.32083484530448914, 0.9556019306182861, 0.999970555305481, 0.3578419089317322, 0.731097936630249, 0.583764910697937, 0.9647988677024841, 0.9999679327011108, 0.9998822212219238, 0.9917442202568054, 0.7298098802566528, 0.9987414479255676, 0.49364081025123596, 0.9944739937782288, 0.9999890327453613, 0.9836490154266357, 0.9914650321006775, 0.6145287156105042]}

The sentiment subjectivity classification is based on the overall tone and sentiment expressed in the text as a whole, which in this case is negative due to the frustration and limitation conveyed by the sentiment phrase.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "can", "'", "t", "we", "'", "is", "negative", ".", "The", "reason", "is", "that", "the", "phrase", "express", "es", "a", "sense", "of", "frustration", "and", "limitation", ",", "which", "can", "be", "perceived", "as", "a", "negative", "action", "towards", "finding", "a", "solution", "for", "environmental", "sustain", "ability", ".", "However", ",", "it", "'", "s", "important", "to", "note", "that", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "itself", "does", "not", "contain", "any", "explicitly", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "specific", "actions", "being", "discussed", ",", "such", "as", "b", "anning", "plastic", "bags", "or", "requiring", "manufacturers", "to", "find", "ways", "for", "consumers", "to", "rec", "ycle", "their", "products", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "classification", "is", "based", "on", "the", "overall", "tone", "and", "sentiment", "expressed", "in", "the", "text", "as", "a", "whole", ",", "which", "in", "this", "case", "is", "negative", "due", "to", "the", "frustration", "and", "limitation", "convey", "ed", "by", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.880813717842102, 0.6917211413383484, 0.9562394022941589, 0.755170464515686, 0.999975323677063, 0.5077925324440002, 0.9019932746887207, 0.5704615712165833, 0.9926472902297974, 0.9994202852249146, 0.603536069393158, 0.976666271686554, 0.9605701565742493, 0.999852180480957, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9989564418792725, 0.9545536637306213, 0.40889671444892883, 0.44507378339767456, 0.6146566867828369, 0.2391030192375183, 0.7410005331039429, 0.9326839447021484, 0.8242354989051819, 0.40038737654685974, 0.44656553864479065, 0.9999744892120361, 0.510054349899292, 0.6028743982315063, 0.9999321699142456, 0.8139354586601257, 0.632677435874939, 0.35150980949401855, 0.8184239268302917, 0.3460627496242523, 0.3846837878227234, 0.8281147480010986, 0.4251483082771301, 0.9985333681106567, 0.8281144499778748, 0.6664074063301086, 0.36594706773757935, 0.7117868065834045, 0.6943064332008362, 0.8908399939537048, 0.9828019738197327, 0.4857625961303711, 0.4782467484474182, 0.9179301261901855, 0.999997615814209, 0.6827059388160706, 0.37526121735572815, 0.9999537467956543, 0.6491755247116089, 0.614767849445343, 0.9999994039535522, 0.8722474575042725, 0.9999715089797974, 0.9939817786216736, 0.9999079704284668, 0.9078784584999084, 0.5966736674308777, 0.8405671715736389, 0.6844701766967773, 0.7548706531524658, 0.9999781847000122, 0.2174198478460312, 0.9181959629058838, 0.3799518644809723, 0.8989459872245789, 0.9999709129333496, 0.9999617338180542, 0.5385898947715759, 0.435110867023468, 0.9048413634300232, 0.2302747666835785, 0.6027352809906006, 0.8478464484214783, 0.6025905609130859, 0.5145832896232605, 0.7833067774772644, 0.9999979734420776, 0.9319226145744324, 0.9998502731323242, 0.9999806880950928, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9938274025917053, 0.7241362929344177, 0.5972762703895569, 0.5934190154075623, 0.9169031977653503, 0.8930257558822632, 0.9939180612564087, 0.7024138569831848, 1.0, 0.9999492168426514, 0.9999971389770508, 0.453081876039505, 0.9838961362838745, 0.9999130964279175, 0.7418559193611145, 0.5377900004386902, 0.9004931449890137, 0.9999994039535522, 0.7201871275901794, 0.624189555644989, 0.9872341156005859, 0.7512729167938232, 0.9999046325683594, 0.913895845413208, 0.6427865624427795, 0.8696064949035645, 0.4901549816131592, 0.41210252046585083, 0.8610197305679321, 0.9999887943267822, 0.4112163484096527, 0.6652789115905762, 0.999961256980896, 0.9999986886978149, 0.7806033492088318, 0.7611988186836243, 0.6428146958351135, 0.9999431371688843, 0.9993994235992432, 0.5698109269142151, 0.9510990381240845, 0.8875868320465088, 0.9999885559082031, 0.9896807074546814, 0.6577737927436829, 0.9641149640083313, 0.9529728293418884, 0.33021703362464905, 1.0, 0.7020105719566345, 0.9921453595161438, 0.8355225324630737, 0.9997996687889099, 0.8488605618476868, 0.8089801669120789]}

Therefore, while the sentiment phrase itself is neutral, the overall sentiment towards the topic of 'food safety' in the text is likely to be negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "of", "too", "much", "'", "is", "'", "neut", "ral", "'", "because", "it", "does", "not", "express", "a", "clear", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "amount", "or", "excess", "iveness", "of", "food", "safety", ".", "The", "phrase", "'", "too", "much", "'", "can", "be", "interpreted", "as", "an", "objective", "description", "rather", "than", "a", "sentiment", "expression", ".", "However", ",", "based", "on", "the", "context", "provided", ",", "it", "is", "more", "likely", "that", "the", "sentiment", "towards", "'", "too", "much", "food", "safety", "'", "is", "negative", "due", "to", "the", "potential", "risks", "and", "costs", "associated", "with", "excessive", "regulations", "and", "ins", "pe", "ctions", ".", "Therefore", ",", "while", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "itself", "is", "neutral", ",", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "topic", "of", "'", "food", "safety", "'", "in", "the", "text", "is", "likely", "to", "be", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7931506037712097, 0.6204968094825745, 0.9014878869056702, 0.6724381446838379, 0.9999680519104004, 0.5468196272850037, 0.4906349778175354, 0.5416923761367798, 0.99931800365448, 0.6037865281105042, 0.9994897842407227, 0.9999946355819702, 0.9999974966049194, 0.9993995428085327, 0.8401183485984802, 0.3634647727012634, 0.6488303542137146, 0.9999833106994629, 0.4851217567920685, 0.5254165530204773, 0.6080904006958008, 0.6495038270950317, 0.9994695782661438, 0.2817198634147644, 0.4659912884235382, 0.6344760060310364, 0.9610739350318909, 0.9987998008728027, 0.9999594688415527, 0.5229885578155518, 0.9031936526298523, 0.8665124177932739, 0.12635007500648499, 0.5227456092834473, 0.24941866099834442, 0.9049856662750244, 0.6444036960601807, 0.36976906657218933, 0.9999769926071167, 0.2828163802623749, 0.45756617188453674, 0.2576140761375427, 0.61676424741745, 0.5699528455734253, 0.9999953508377075, 0.6825978755950928, 0.45193207263946533, 0.6806490421295166, 0.6649377346038818, 0.6710174679756165, 0.36249685287475586, 0.5179335474967957, 0.37287193536758423, 0.49454039335250854, 0.9999861717224121, 0.6339757442474365, 0.4390304386615753, 0.4535253942012787, 0.7440794110298157, 0.4094420373439789, 0.9999873638153076, 0.3546910881996155, 0.9994970560073853, 0.9864962697029114, 0.43764203786849976, 0.39282456040382385, 0.464862585067749, 0.5490571856498718, 0.6238963603973389, 0.4542095959186554, 0.8994556069374084, 0.4597906768321991, 0.6813316345214844, 0.6381009817123413, 0.6100759506225586, 0.5554117560386658, 0.5958977341651917, 0.9999951124191284, 0.9318602681159973, 0.9999853372573853, 0.9997318387031555, 0.6753979921340942, 0.973944902420044, 0.3296457529067993, 0.9997715353965759, 0.7684257626533508, 0.6251280307769775, 0.7921295762062073, 0.7066917419433594, 0.49158141016960144, 0.9478681087493896, 0.9985263347625732, 0.8367774486541748, 0.6978782415390015, 0.8721866011619568, 0.8167911767959595, 0.9999990463256836, 1.0, 0.7974873185157776, 0.4180183708667755, 0.9999929666519165, 0.3508223295211792, 0.9774686098098755, 0.99162358045578, 0.9686782956123352, 0.9594928622245789, 0.9914602041244507, 0.95869380235672, 0.9992247819900513, 0.9512559771537781, 0.47222650051116943, 0.9623278379440308, 0.8464564681053162, 0.4889131188392639, 0.5905499458312988, 0.7388342618942261, 0.7598861455917358, 0.5704116225242615, 0.9999940395355225, 0.9995850920677185, 0.410259485244751, 0.5005805492401123, 0.9161310195922852, 0.7249936461448669, 0.7810095548629761, 0.6943005323410034, 0.9999474287033081, 0.9986553192138672, 0.4804368019104004, 0.8775920271873474]}

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity cannot be determined based on the sentiment phrase alone.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "pl", "astic", "neutral", "'", "is", "'", "neut", "ral", "'.", "The", "reason", "is", "that", "the", "term", "'", "pl", "astic", "neutral", "'", "itself", "does", "not", "convey", "a", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", ",", "but", "rather", "it", "refers", "to", "a", "state", "or", "goal", "of", "bal", "ancing", "the", "amount", "of", "plastic", "waste", "produced", "with", "the", "amount", "removed", "or", "recycl", "ed", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "does", "not", "indicate", "whether", "the", "action", "towards", "achieving", "plastic", "neutral", "ity", "is", "sinc", "ere", "or", "ins", "inc", "ere", ",", "or", "whether", "it", "has", "positive", "or", "negative", "impacts", "on", "other", "aspects", ",", "as", "mentioned", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "cannot", "be", "determined", "based", "on", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "alone", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7583311796188354, 0.8165158629417419, 0.9338715672492981, 0.8551600575447083, 0.9999790191650391, 0.748055636882782, 0.8929733037948608, 0.498788058757782, 0.9951090216636658, 0.9996435642242432, 0.718734622001648, 0.9992029070854187, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9994779229164124, 0.9996091723442078, 0.9798547625541687, 0.7074605822563171, 0.6298655867576599, 0.9999970197677612, 0.48604056239128113, 0.465295672416687, 0.4298054575920105, 0.7249208092689514, 0.9501455426216125, 0.465175062417984, 0.537799060344696, 0.9845073223114014, 0.9999088048934937, 0.9999988079071045, 0.9998536109924316, 0.999300479888916, 0.7833855152130127, 0.5102013349533081, 0.999505877494812, 0.30934080481529236, 0.6089474558830261, 0.6531165838241577, 0.9965916872024536, 0.9963186979293823, 0.902455747127533, 0.28329944610595703, 0.3768751919269562, 0.8183586001396179, 0.15763069689273834, 0.24332624673843384, 0.9998179078102112, 0.4047204554080963, 0.772083580493927, 0.6467719078063965, 0.4393045902252197, 0.5767378807067871, 0.2423911988735199, 0.9999967813491821, 0.47235313057899475, 0.8303097486495972, 0.999649167060852, 0.989728569984436, 0.5616360902786255, 0.4958554208278656, 0.9317756295204163, 0.6134014129638672, 0.8541038036346436, 0.27356278896331787, 0.5180289149284363, 0.65845787525177, 0.9999982118606567, 0.7700977921485901, 0.2665901482105255, 0.7197130918502808, 0.8088740706443787, 0.48500731587409973, 0.9898180365562439, 0.33201664686203003, 0.7460147738456726, 0.6919023394584656, 0.19874630868434906, 0.38499072194099426, 0.39668431878089905, 0.5032752752304077, 0.999875545501709, 0.9974714517593384, 0.9920859932899475, 0.48606905341148376, 0.9999083280563354, 0.6508017778396606, 0.5756681561470032, 0.9998754262924194, 0.9999988079071045, 0.9263352751731873, 0.3762812316417694, 0.6523982882499695, 0.6220361590385437, 0.4132532775402069, 0.7589886784553528, 0.9948233366012573, 0.9999377727508545, 0.45732784271240234, 0.7364582419395447, 0.7866450548171997, 0.6395605802536011, 0.4076213240623474, 0.351062148809433, 0.15874983370304108, 0.999618411064148, 0.9983364939689636, 0.8687771558761597, 0.9997876286506653, 0.9742029309272766, 0.6046646237373352, 0.9999145269393921, 0.48349717259407043, 0.99365234375, 0.9914871454238892, 0.9999977350234985, 0.45914533734321594, 0.999853253364563, 0.841546356678009, 0.7216268181800842, 0.9384222626686096, 0.65024733543396, 0.7559292316436768, 0.9996657371520996, 0.9939557909965515, 0.785832941532135, 0.7618862390518188]}

Therefore, the negative sentiment subjectivity is a reasonable classification for this sentiment phrase.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "at", "the", "expense", "'", "is", "'", "negative", "'.", "This", "is", "because", "the", "phrase", "'", "at", "the", "expense", "'", "implies", "that", "one", "thing", "is", "being", "sacrific", "ed", "or", "given", "up", "in", "order", "to", "achieve", "another", ",", "which", "can", "be", "perceived", "as", "a", "loss", "or", "negative", "consequence", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "phrase", "suggests", "that", "the", "'", "rap", "id", "progress", "'", "towards", "low", "carbon", "transitions", "may", "come", "at", "the", "cost", "of", "something", "else", ",", "such", "as", "social", "justice", ",", "which", "is", "generally", "considered", "a", "des", "irable", "aspect", "of", "society", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "is", "a", "reasonable", "classification", "for", "this", "sentiment", "phrase", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8160194158554077, 0.6715359091758728, 0.9517716765403748, 0.6296201944351196, 0.9999752044677734, 0.5636833310127258, 0.9372645616531372, 0.4619935154914856, 0.9918334484100342, 0.9996718168258667, 0.6588180065155029, 0.9999077320098877, 0.9999992847442627, 0.9999006986618042, 0.9970496892929077, 0.9858908653259277, 0.5002574324607849, 0.9324860572814941, 0.596628725528717, 0.6462203860282898, 0.7943617701530457, 0.9635926485061646, 0.7985564470291138, 0.8809017539024353, 0.3892216980457306, 0.9999667406082153, 0.9999988079071045, 0.9999891519546509, 0.9440674781799316, 0.37164148688316345, 0.6099894642829895, 0.4466591477394104, 0.9779815077781677, 0.8494632840156555, 0.9668753743171692, 0.7625727653503418, 0.9999982118606567, 0.8064903020858765, 0.5299862623214722, 0.9998496770858765, 0.6595170497894287, 0.9974576830863953, 0.9873600602149963, 0.9326086640357971, 0.8294491171836853, 0.8801074624061584, 0.5420819520950317, 0.4586203992366791, 0.6992625594139099, 0.3770192265510559, 0.9667577147483826, 0.9845424890518188, 0.803920328617096, 0.9901767373085022, 0.4838078022003174, 0.8073890209197998, 0.8016358017921448, 0.7216044068336487, 0.6541496515274048, 0.925216019153595, 0.9988470077514648, 0.914330780506134, 0.4593646228313446, 0.5623785257339478, 0.9972934126853943, 0.634661853313446, 0.7569464445114136, 0.9988288283348083, 1.0, 0.9999910593032837, 0.9988448619842529, 0.43322494626045227, 0.34732145071029663, 0.9111382961273193, 0.9825810790061951, 0.6938418745994568, 0.8100537657737732, 0.9784557223320007, 0.9721153378486633, 0.8488467335700989, 0.9080767035484314, 0.4178653359413147, 0.7503654360771179, 0.9695000648498535, 0.6059429049491882, 0.9999532699584961, 0.998859167098999, 0.9999644756317139, 0.6764782667160034, 0.7888706922531128, 0.9100711345672607, 0.41859525442123413, 0.8471243381500244, 0.917666494846344, 0.5780937075614929, 0.9999842643737793, 0.5874651670455933, 0.9972875118255615, 0.8555185198783875, 0.8318368196487427, 0.592736542224884, 0.9992319345474243, 0.9021288156509399, 0.47592130303382874, 0.9435496926307678, 0.9498597979545593, 0.9999884366989136, 0.3899604380130768, 0.2755354642868042, 0.5161026120185852, 0.9464432001113892, 0.40052229166030884, 0.6829322576522827, 0.7731990814208984, 0.9998443126678467, 0.7424106001853943, 0.8272630572319031]}

The sentiment subjectivity classification is based solely on the given sentiment phrase and does not take into account the broader context of the text.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "big", "gest", "threat", "'", "is", "negative", ",", "as", "the", "term", "'", "th", "reat", "'", "typically", "implies", "a", "potential", "for", "harm", "or", "danger", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "threat", "of", "climate", "change", "is", "a", "serious", "issue", "that", "pos", "es", "risks", "to", "humanity", "and", "the", "environment", ".", "However", ",", "it", "'", "s", "important", "to", "note", "that", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "does", "not", "necessarily", "convey", "a", "completely", "negative", "sentiment", ",", "as", "the", "text", "also", "ment", "ions", "the", "opportunities", "that", "come", "with", "addressing", "this", "challenge", ",", "such", "as", "investing", "in", "clean", "energy", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "classification", "is", "based", "solely", "on", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "and", "does", "not", "take", "into", "account", "the", "broader", "context", "of", "the", "text", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7087269425392151, 0.7596279382705688, 0.9896346926689148, 0.919790506362915, 0.9999834299087524, 0.5763033628463745, 0.9271180033683777, 0.5243468880653381, 0.9996364116668701, 0.5090987086296082, 0.9997203946113586, 0.9999947547912598, 0.9999061822891235, 0.9997122883796692, 0.751628041267395, 0.7402257323265076, 0.35529860854148865, 0.9570797681808472, 0.4914182126522064, 0.4833473265171051, 0.9963983297348022, 0.9468849301338196, 1.0, 0.9998705387115479, 0.24167264997959137, 0.35870036482810974, 0.3855583965778351, 0.2838096618652344, 0.5368505120277405, 0.9515613317489624, 0.8273751139640808, 0.9238181710243225, 0.5203537940979004, 0.2925657331943512, 0.7498531341552734, 0.8541761636734009, 0.9925285577774048, 0.4470505714416504, 0.2145186960697174, 0.6741317510604858, 0.9996465444564819, 0.9999240636825562, 0.47767218947410583, 0.2946133613586426, 0.49878817796707153, 0.48353755474090576, 0.8375682830810547, 0.36295145750045776, 1.0, 0.28979846835136414, 0.7937883138656616, 0.5323917865753174, 0.6079446077346802, 0.9873199462890625, 0.8032604455947876, 0.7683125138282776, 0.45562779903411865, 0.9999942779541016, 0.7258671522140503, 0.6099454164505005, 0.9999998807907104, 0.761185884475708, 0.9999489784240723, 0.981015682220459, 0.9989882111549377, 0.8914394974708557, 0.7498234510421753, 0.8370868563652039, 0.6459327936172485, 0.9995310306549072, 0.2761663794517517, 0.3242630958557129, 0.8279730081558228, 0.8330139517784119, 0.9911735653877258, 0.7734454274177551, 0.8874644041061401, 0.9987797141075134, 0.8820048570632935, 0.7384387850761414, 0.9779348969459534, 0.621673047542572, 1.0, 0.7811562418937683, 0.7668828368186951, 0.4615400731563568, 0.9509578943252563, 0.9988393187522888, 0.9844239354133606, 0.49252602458000183, 0.898168683052063, 0.7458942532539368, 0.9805461764335632, 0.9999978542327881, 0.6756410598754883, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9999638795852661, 0.9999479055404663, 0.8814033269882202, 0.5216245651245117, 0.3123399615287781, 0.9468966126441956, 0.9999862909317017, 0.5940629243850708, 0.44168782234191895, 0.8357900381088257, 0.6109938025474548, 0.9999979734420776, 0.9999674558639526, 0.4701266884803772, 0.9753456115722656, 0.9998406171798706, 0.8777826428413391, 0.3540186583995819, 0.9999830722808838, 0.7469376921653748, 0.9997707009315491, 0.9968410730361938, 0.9244347214698792, 0.5322629809379578, 0.9940046668052673, 0.9637948274612427, 0.9999984502792358, 0.9977532029151917, 0.9857370853424072, 0.9796791076660156]}
