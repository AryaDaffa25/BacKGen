In this case, the sentiment subjectivity of the sentiment phrase 'expensive' is neutral.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "exp", "ensive", "'", "is", "neutral", "in", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "as", "it", "does", "not", "express", "any", "positive", "or", "negative", "emotion", "towards", "the", "subject", ",", "but", "rather", "describes", "a", "fact", "ual", "condition", ".", "The", "text", "discuss", "es", "various", "expenses", "related", "to", "travel", "and", "quar", "antine", "due", "to", "the", "pandemic", ",", "and", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "exp", "ensive", "'", "can", "be", "applied", "to", "many", "aspects", "of", "the", "text", ",", "such", "as", "flights", ",", "cov", "id", "tests", ",", "and", "quar", "antine", "accommod", "ations", ".", "However", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "itself", "does", "not", "express", "any", "emotion", "towards", "these", "expenses", ",", "and", "it", "is", "up", "to", "the", "reader", "to", "determine", "whether", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", "is", "positive", "or", "negative", "based", "on", "other", "sentiment", "phrases", "and", "context", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "exp", "ensive", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9176624417304993, 0.8413200974464417, 0.949564516544342, 0.7584208250045776, 0.6121669411659241, 0.9998793005943298, 0.999988853931427, 0.9992760419845581, 0.6308175921440125, 0.3509003520011902, 0.5030362606048584, 0.39169833064079285, 0.9938022494316101, 0.9999886155128479, 0.4972169101238251, 0.942682683467865, 0.6781933903694153, 0.9999696612358093, 0.40619295835494995, 0.4528384208679199, 0.4130270779132843, 0.9983653426170349, 0.9998408555984497, 0.8846319317817688, 0.866632878780365, 0.7327070236206055, 0.7418455481529236, 0.3537125289440155, 0.7899996042251587, 0.8346464037895203, 0.35406795144081116, 0.8027350306510925, 0.9529380798339844, 0.5427516102790833, 0.2803782820701599, 0.6481391787528992, 0.5426907539367676, 0.2632650136947632, 0.2740132510662079, 0.999962568283081, 0.7336465716362, 0.566287100315094, 0.8286522030830383, 0.9999955296516418, 0.42592257261276245, 0.6342160105705261, 0.8282017111778259, 0.9974210262298584, 0.4714484214782715, 0.999995768070221, 0.5896800756454468, 0.6294180154800415, 0.8426288962364197, 0.4290669560432434, 0.8596174716949463, 0.9703593850135803, 0.9987853765487671, 0.9455845355987549, 0.9999356269836426, 0.9999487400054932, 0.9998509883880615, 0.28129488229751587, 0.5701327919960022, 0.9194427728652954, 0.9929777383804321, 0.34702053666114807, 0.3561577796936035, 0.7414054274559021, 0.8465879559516907, 0.6763201355934143, 0.6937388181686401, 0.41015011072158813, 0.9999986290931702, 0.9746500849723816, 0.9989078640937805, 0.5848378539085388, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9999599456787109, 0.9999874830245972, 0.5100262761116028, 0.48096963763237, 0.9996774196624756, 0.31457290053367615, 1.0, 0.8292699456214905, 0.498989462852478, 0.9999991655349731, 0.8734729886054993, 0.9437558650970459, 0.7671753168106079, 0.673669159412384, 0.9802952408790588, 0.9999834299087524, 0.48966848850250244, 0.9586786031723022, 0.4541037678718567, 0.7756381034851074, 0.9144997000694275, 0.9723060131072998, 0.8698553442955017, 0.32940569519996643, 0.827053427696228, 0.6497548818588257, 0.3333635628223419, 0.9999935626983643, 0.9928334355354309, 0.7257028222084045, 0.9672461748123169, 0.42343616485595703, 0.6853942275047302, 0.6565180420875549, 0.3351871967315674, 0.9724594354629517, 0.6973482370376587, 0.9999405145645142, 0.9935317039489746, 0.9973711967468262, 0.9984422922134399, 0.9599547982215881, 0.9999903440475464, 0.9935994148254395, 0.9999983906745911, 0.5958823561668396, 0.31550872325897217, 0.9981281757354736, 0.9721691012382507, 0.6891109347343445, 0.4143785834312439, 0.39027807116508484, 0.9152616858482361, 0.9411546587944031, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9186339974403381, 0.594795823097229, 0.4905223548412323, 0.9999934434890747, 0.9013726115226746, 0.7268293499946594, 0.5020159482955933, 0.9997594952583313, 0.9806734919548035, 0.9998764991760254, 0.9999966025352478, 0.9999899864196777, 0.9949431419372559, 0.9924483895301819, 0.5512743592262268, 0.6714469194412231], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.3509003520011902}

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity for the sentiment phrase 'shocked' is neutral.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "sh", "ocked", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "itself", "does", "not", "convey", "a", "positive", "or", "negative", "emotion", ",", "but", "rather", "an", "expression", "of", "surprise", "or", "dis", "bel", "ief", ".", "The", "context", "of", "the", "text", ",", "which", "ment", "ions", "the", "dirty", "and", "rund", "own", "condition", "of", "public", "rest", "rooms", "in", "N", "W", "I", "A", "and", "the", "contrast", "ing", "clean", "and", "updated", "environment", "in", "M", "N", ",", "does", "not", "provide", "enough", "information", "to", "determine", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "as", "positive", "or", "negative", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "depends", "on", "the", "specific", "emotion", "or", "attitude", "associated", "with", "the", "feeling", "of", "being", "shocked", ",", "which", "is", "not", "explicitly", "stated", "in", "the", "text", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "sh", "ocked", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9105890989303589, 0.7508670687675476, 0.9956237077713013, 0.5570724606513977, 0.9995966553688049, 0.6711059212684631, 0.9640969634056091, 0.7760109901428223, 0.9997492432594299, 0.5904221534729004, 0.9999443292617798, 0.9998647570610046, 0.9979854822158813, 0.42531973123550415, 0.7005414366722107, 0.4650426208972931, 0.6615282893180847, 0.6303536295890808, 0.9665223360061646, 0.3161400556564331, 0.7631192207336426, 0.999437153339386, 0.2554923892021179, 0.4618767499923706, 0.8287175893783569, 0.9943411350250244, 0.99598228931427, 0.7786158919334412, 0.4564865529537201, 0.805837094783783, 0.9399421215057373, 0.3608373701572418, 0.38677093386650085, 0.9998378753662109, 0.9879865050315857, 0.898856520652771, 0.7811384797096252, 0.9839785695075989, 0.9999907612800598, 0.9421485066413879, 0.5037822723388672, 0.3292081952095032, 0.663003146648407, 0.9973511099815369, 0.8375862836837769, 0.34837374091148376, 0.7942909002304077, 0.456449955701828, 1.0, 0.7236465215682983, 0.48803889751434326, 0.9984143376350403, 0.9944835305213928, 0.9999999403953552, 0.471585750579834, 0.9999921321868896, 0.7547478079795837, 0.9999525547027588, 0.9998149871826172, 0.5342677235603333, 0.8923528790473938, 0.9999894499778748, 0.9192323088645935, 0.9998686909675598, 0.7174760103225708, 0.8187891840934753, 0.5155855417251587, 0.6046226024627686, 0.9403023719787598, 0.8444607257843018, 0.9992369413375854, 0.8861817717552185, 0.6945469379425049, 0.99952632188797, 0.9999316930770874, 0.991284191608429, 0.3361457884311676, 0.9522331357002258, 0.7675131559371948, 0.8462422490119934, 0.9413372278213501, 0.9881512522697449, 0.7363331913948059, 0.5265148878097534, 0.9862262606620789, 0.5751557946205139, 0.999986469745636, 0.9613301157951355, 0.8109288215637207, 0.8887141346931458, 0.99977046251297, 0.2673797607421875, 0.7169207334518433, 0.999760091304779, 0.9999896883964539, 0.8794226050376892, 0.48511597514152527, 0.7706292271614075, 0.45727917551994324, 0.9999066591262817, 0.638919472694397, 0.8602514863014221, 0.6997320055961609, 0.9798557162284851, 0.276450514793396, 0.9855872392654419, 0.9929649233818054, 0.7762144804000854, 0.4725818336009979, 0.924467921257019, 0.3662015199661255, 0.33146315813064575, 0.9999920725822449, 0.9933890104293823, 0.40379589796066284, 0.9999727606773376, 0.5907186269760132, 0.9881013631820679, 0.7791317701339722, 0.9642558693885803, 0.5975156426429749, 0.9979758858680725, 0.5141071677207947, 0.9842013716697693, 0.9506294131278992, 0.9972055554389954, 0.8824021816253662, 0.8394913077354431, 0.23593704402446747, 0.999980092048645, 0.5889176726341248, 0.9935092926025391, 0.9982059597969055, 0.9999983310699463, 0.5538264513015747, 0.8882507681846619, 0.9912828207015991, 0.9998996257781982, 0.9574150443077087, 0.9999979138374329, 0.9998931884765625, 0.9999677538871765, 0.9535309672355652, 0.9780709147453308, 0.9651966094970703, 0.5110355019569397], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.7005414366722107}

Instilling fear in those seeking plant-based diets and the lack of viable alternatives to certain foods further exacerbate these issues. Ultimately, the world is in a precarious state, with numerous causes leading to harm and destruction.", "The excessive use and dispersal of toxic substances, such as sewage waste and chemicals, is a major issue that negatively impacts our environment and health. The production and consumption of these substances are often justified with false claims and misinformation, leading to their widespread use and normalization.

The continuous release and dispersal of these substances, often through political means, only worsens the situation and makes it increasingly difficult to reverse the damage.", "The world is plagued by various harmful substances and practices, from genetically modified foods and toxic chemicals to raw sewage and industrial waste. These issues pose significant risks to our health and well-being, with some even surpassing the dangers of war and violence. The perpetrators of these problems, be they corporations or governments, often seem to believe they are exempt from the consequences, leaving the rest of us to suffer. The situation is further complicated by the media's obsession with clickbait and misinformation, which only serves to confuse and mislead the public. Ultimately, it is up to us to demand change and prioritize the health of our citizens and the environment, rather than allowing these issues to continue unchecked.", "The world is plagued by numerous entities and situations that are far from normal and cause significant harm to our environment and health. From massive carbon footprints and factory farms to limited resources and huge losses of capital, the negative impact of these entities is overwhelming. The size of the problem is immense, and the consequences of ignoring it can be devastating. It is crucial that we acknowledge the severity of the situation and take action to reduce our own contributions to these issues, no matter how small they may seem. Only then can we hope to make a positive difference and create a more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.", "The constant exposure to harmful substances and practices, as highlighted in various media and personal experiences, poses a significant threat to our health and well-being.

Some inventions, like plastic, have brought about significant environmental challenges, but with collective efforts, we can minimize their negative impact. Similarly, certain practices, such as agriculture and energy generation, can have a significant impact on the environment, and it is crucial to find sustainable solutions to mitigate these effects. Competition and innovation are essential drivers for progress, and we must seize opportunities to make our industries more productive, resilient, and sustainable. The world has historically led to a better future, and while there may be some short-term challenges, we must look ahead and work towards long-term solutions. The most sustainable networks, like Telos, are leading the way in this regard, and we must continue to support and invest in such initiatives.", "The world is rich in resources and initiatives aimed at improving the lives of individuals and the health of the planet. From the development of national standards of health for all populations to the construction of waste collection and segregation sheds in rural India, the commitment to reducing waste and improving well-being is evident. Additionally, the use of renewable energy sources, such as geothermal energy in Texas, is saving significant amounts of money and reducing our carbon footprint.

Therefore, the negative sentiment subjectivity of the sentiment phrase 'hostage' is a fitting reflection of the text's overall sentiment towards Senator Manchin's actions.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "host", "age", "'", "is", "negative", ".", "The", "reason", "is", "that", "the", "word", "'", "host", "age", "'", "implies", "a", "situation", "of", "control", "or", "capt", "ivity", ",", "often", "with", "negative", "con", "notations", ",", "especially", "when", "used", "in", "the", "context", "of", "political", "or", "environmental", "issues", ",", "as", "in", "the", "text", ",", "where", "it", "refers", "to", "Senator", "Man", "ch", "in", "'", "s", "perceived", "obst", "ruction", "of", "progress", "towards", "renew", "able", "energy", "and", "environmental", "protection", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", "provided", "emphas", "ize", "the", "importance", "of", "taking", "care", "of", "the", "environment", "and", "reducing", "our", "impact", "on", "it", ",", "while", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "phrases", "illustr", "ate", "the", "negative", "consequences", "of", "neglect", "ing", "this", "responsibility", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "host", "age", "'", "is", "a", "fitting", "reflection", "of", "the", "text", "'", "s", "overall", "sentiment", "towards", "Senator", "Man", "ch", "in", "'", "s", "actions", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8540467023849487, 0.7453829050064087, 0.987395703792572, 0.7102269530296326, 0.9999586343765259, 0.6833088397979736, 0.986013650894165, 0.6521834135055542, 0.9997513890266418, 0.6452847123146057, 0.9823266267776489, 0.9991033673286438, 0.9979563355445862, 0.611220121383667, 0.9829648733139038, 0.6125791072845459, 0.4393261671066284, 0.4345264136791229, 0.6747329235076904, 0.9754312038421631, 0.7906864881515503, 0.4320808947086334, 0.9823920726776123, 0.9999834299087524, 0.9999974966049194, 0.9989539384841919, 0.4060686528682709, 0.606393039226532, 0.6797987222671509, 0.4975301921367645, 0.6070830821990967, 0.42974308133125305, 0.3869743049144745, 0.9991717338562012, 0.7815678119659424, 0.49524015188217163, 0.4671812951564789, 0.732420802116394, 0.8725103735923767, 0.9976181387901306, 0.6770179271697998, 0.3766232132911682, 0.9054423570632935, 0.5051822662353516, 0.8850345611572266, 0.48964792490005493, 0.9809346199035645, 0.9974365830421448, 0.4935535490512848, 0.8007047772407532, 0.9533337950706482, 0.9155541062355042, 0.44717004895210266, 0.4597169756889343, 0.8930271863937378, 0.6589626669883728, 0.7069607377052307, 0.3375130891799927, 0.9090348482131958, 0.6337037682533264, 0.3862467110157013, 0.999975323677063, 0.23286183178424835, 0.9997534155845642, 1.0, 0.9999881982803345, 0.5985767245292664, 0.9999673366546631, 0.3357526957988739, 0.36329004168510437, 0.9968798756599426, 0.441037654876709, 0.8692157864570618, 0.9527926445007324, 0.6180892586708069, 0.9999982118606567, 0.9999040365219116, 0.820675253868103, 0.6009248495101929, 0.6635103225708008, 0.8015215992927551, 0.7427242398262024, 0.717807948589325, 0.9997384548187256, 0.6855539679527283, 0.9846159219741821, 0.8328232169151306, 0.18616259098052979, 0.9997408390045166, 0.9998558163642883, 0.826583981513977, 0.9672501683235168, 0.5560387372970581, 0.6771726608276367, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9883860349655151, 0.8081049919128418, 0.943263053894043, 0.4689216613769531, 0.9275349974632263, 0.9378851652145386, 0.9997880458831787, 0.899787425994873, 0.9312242865562439, 0.5500666499137878, 0.8937885761260986, 0.5349416732788086, 0.7569581270217896, 0.8333330154418945, 0.4381869435310364, 0.9999987483024597, 0.8836773633956909, 0.5541729927062988, 0.9772509932518005, 0.9582160711288452, 0.4897294044494629, 0.5797929763793945, 0.4895341694355011, 0.8021628260612488, 0.858429491519928, 0.6154630184173584, 0.999984860420227, 0.9482942223548889, 0.36018750071525574, 0.9955116510391235, 0.7175796031951904, 0.9999973177909851, 0.9459469318389893, 0.8391050100326538, 0.7910147309303284, 0.9998049736022949, 0.9965015649795532, 0.9999925494194031, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9995085000991821, 0.4427576959133148, 0.40540823340415955, 0.6286196112632751, 0.5334221720695496, 0.9999999403953552, 0.8878023028373718, 0.34452152252197266, 0.9990642070770264, 0.9999852180480957, 0.6790741086006165, 0.5440891981124878, 0.8997799158096313, 0.7739591598510742, 0.9999902844429016, 1.0, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9796642661094666, 0.9999951124191284, 0.9462018609046936, 0.9600846171379089, 0.9941216707229614], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.9829648733139038}

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity of the sentiment phrase \"never ends well\" is negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "never", "ends", "well", "\"", "is", "negative", "in", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "as", "it", "implies", "a", "lack", "of", "resolution", "or", "a", "negative", "outcome", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", "provided", "suggest", "that", "negative", "sentiment", "phrases", "often", "relate", "to", "issues", "that", "are", "not", "being", "addressed", "or", "resolved", ",", "such", "as", "environmental", "de", "grad", "ation", ",", "economic", "inst", "ability", ",", "and", "fraud", "ulent", "practices", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "never", "ends", "well", "\"", "implies", "that", "the", "situation", "described", "in", "the", "text", ",", "which", "is", "the", "power", "of", "the", "car", "lobby", "over", "urban", "planning", ",", "is", "likely", "to", "have", "negative", "consequences", "that", "pers", "ist", "and", "are", "not", "resolved", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "never", "ends", "well", "\"", "is", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.908806324005127, 0.754737377166748, 0.9604883193969727, 0.695831298828125, 0.7493888735771179, 0.9987615942955017, 0.9999774694442749, 0.9999982118606567, 0.9990509748458862, 0.4281459450721741, 0.8382958173751831, 0.2928302586078644, 0.4769934117794037, 0.985967755317688, 0.9999899864196777, 0.3487156629562378, 0.9761593341827393, 0.423278272151947, 0.7032387852668762, 0.36534541845321655, 0.9997936487197876, 0.512795627117157, 0.8957388997077942, 0.4054851830005646, 0.39935797452926636, 0.991732656955719, 0.22041600942611694, 0.5591964721679688, 0.3193790912628174, 0.9893573522567749, 0.454983651638031, 0.8604199290275574, 0.6434215307235718, 0.24896475672721863, 0.9502722024917603, 0.6366650462150574, 0.6226930022239685, 0.4378301203250885, 0.605485737323761, 0.39449170231819153, 0.9999960660934448, 0.7334281206130981, 0.7583178877830505, 0.7468839287757874, 0.4857824146747589, 0.6618662476539612, 0.7031735181808472, 0.4456157684326172, 0.689218282699585, 0.6738740801811218, 0.40142232179641724, 0.9999707341194153, 0.6949923038482666, 0.6868149042129517, 0.999991774559021, 0.9999990463256836, 0.7162816524505615, 0.3248666524887085, 0.9746630191802979, 0.9999757409095764, 0.9997208714485168, 0.7361388206481934, 0.321292906999588, 0.7570324540138245, 0.8137794137001038, 0.9541337490081787, 0.5560755133628845, 0.6568557024002075, 0.8086899518966675, 0.9999964237213135, 0.9922851920127869, 0.6049612164497375, 0.9945348501205444, 0.6371651291847229, 0.9966488480567932, 0.9999733567237854, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9999196529388428, 0.2972985506057739, 0.8789375424385071, 0.8324975967407227, 0.43197277188301086, 0.4795149564743042, 0.8998653292655945, 0.9999791383743286, 0.9980733394622803, 0.7998190522193909, 0.6669900417327881, 0.4229557514190674, 0.9609407782554626, 0.7660557627677917, 0.43912583589553833, 0.9996345639228821, 0.9998816847801208, 0.9982434511184692, 0.8679603338241577, 0.9999327063560486, 0.9999907612800598, 0.9164514541625977, 0.4627997875213623, 0.38013309240341187, 0.9997566938400269, 0.5444756746292114, 0.8217629194259644, 0.9933227896690369, 0.6049572229385376, 0.4995379149913788, 0.9999751448631287, 0.23993194103240967, 0.48576706647872925, 0.9697209596633911, 0.49550437927246094, 0.9234911203384399, 0.3145832121372223, 0.9999552965164185, 0.9579543471336365, 0.9881041646003723, 0.7491468191146851, 0.9999968409538269, 0.7751824259757996, 0.6619197130203247, 0.7062920331954956, 0.9999096989631653, 0.7569640278816223, 0.9999712705612183, 0.9999855756759644, 0.999998152256012, 0.999949038028717, 0.9216910600662231, 0.9990197420120239, 0.8781677484512329, 0.9309236407279968], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.8382958173751831}
