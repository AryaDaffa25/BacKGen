The background knowledge about the negative impact of profit-driven actions on the environment and communities further supports the negative sentiment subjectivity classification.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["Neg", "ative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "sm", "oke", "and", "mir", "rors", "\"", "implies", "a", "sense", "of", "de", "ception", "and", "manip", "ulation", ",", "which", "is", "often", "associated", "with", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "a", "subject", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "is", "likely", "being", "used", "to", "critic", "ize", "the", "actions", "of", "the", "Liberal", "Party", ",", "suggesting", "that", "their", "policies", "are", "not", "what", "they", "seem", "and", "are", "not", "in", "the", "best", "interests", "of", "the", "people", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "about", "the", "negative", "impact", "of", "profit", "-", "driven", "actions", "on", "the", "environment", "and", "communities", "further", "supports", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "classification", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.5612012147903442, 0.9999962449073792, 0.4048366844654083, 0.8704389333724976, 0.9999408721923828, 0.3284463882446289, 0.8374109864234924, 0.7310712933540344, 0.9853671789169312, 0.4454359710216522, 0.9998460412025452, 0.999999463558197, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9999929070472717, 0.9992214441299438, 0.9992108941078186, 0.41961443424224854, 0.2932147979736328, 0.3864628076553345, 0.9999352693557739, 0.6376640200614929, 0.998562216758728, 0.4713584780693054, 0.491286963224411, 0.9994401335716248, 0.9114415049552917, 0.5064640045166016, 0.6860702037811279, 0.2716449499130249, 0.866665244102478, 0.999833881855011, 0.9713302850723267, 0.7304580211639404, 0.40854305028915405, 0.44182056188583374, 0.32768237590789795, 0.3913475573062897, 0.4675625264644623, 0.6882930397987366, 0.7378554344177246, 0.9987691044807434, 0.5232157111167908, 0.29316285252571106, 0.5943848490715027, 0.6125057339668274, 0.6233452558517456, 0.4014069437980652, 0.9924700856208801, 0.8872656226158142, 0.6911761164665222, 0.9981851577758789, 0.9881461262702942, 0.3109956979751587, 0.9868522882461548, 0.9943594932556152, 0.7034720778465271, 0.989966094493866, 0.43719398975372314, 0.2897443473339081, 0.7562910914421082, 0.7828074097633362, 0.26938560605049133, 0.47954270243644714, 0.7873444557189941, 0.6165785193443298, 0.9999944567680359, 0.6421710252761841, 0.4667036533355713, 0.5117833614349365, 0.28123465180397034, 0.4072106182575226, 0.9996602535247803, 0.9997739195823669, 0.8441907167434692, 0.999993622303009, 0.7296404242515564, 0.7881591320037842, 0.9018186330795288, 0.5031106472015381, 0.6790969967842102, 0.9972198009490967, 0.43884971737861633, 0.6142762303352356, 0.6146248579025269, 0.46559008955955505, 0.9975833296775818, 0.6464938521385193, 0.9489404559135437, 0.9947242140769958, 0.8493340611457825, 0.6873331665992737, 0.986283540725708, 0.9999617338180542, 0.9326163530349731, 0.8070799112319946, 0.7733438014984131, 0.5300077199935913, 0.5916275382041931, 0.5909518599510193, 0.9753168821334839, 0.3925666809082031, 0.9999794960021973, 0.839350700378418, 0.9451764225959778, 0.9840390682220459], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.5612012147903442}

The background knowledge about the importance of understanding and taking action towards environmental issues highlights the negative implications of this sentiment phrase.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["Neg", "ative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "you", "'", "re", "a", "\"", "is", "often", "used", "in", "a", "der", "og", "atory", "or", "dismiss", "ive", "way", ",", "imp", "lying", "a", "lack", "of", "understanding", "or", "support", "for", "the", "topic", "at", "hand", ",", "which", "in", "this", "case", "is", "the", "environmental", "impact", "of", "the", "Nord", "Stream", "", "2", "oil", "sp", "ill", "and", "the", "role", "of", "the", "Biden", "administration", "in", "addressing", "it", ".", "The", "use", "of", "this", "phrase", "can", "be", "seen", "as", "a", "negative", "attack", "on", "the", "person", "being", "addressed", ",", "rather", "than", "a", "construct", "ive", "contribution", "to", "the", "discussion", "about", "the", "issue", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "about", "the", "importance", "of", "understanding", "and", "taking", "action", "towards", "environmental", "issues", "highlights", "the", "negative", "implications", "of", "this", "sentiment", "phrase", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.5611367225646973, 0.9999973773956299, 0.7219587564468384, 0.8597592115402222, 0.9999364018440247, 0.2746331989765167, 0.8180981874465942, 0.5996928811073303, 0.9953252673149109, 0.5169342756271362, 0.9977855086326599, 0.9985149502754211, 0.9999942183494568, 0.9999976754188538, 0.9991866946220398, 0.5379692912101746, 0.6274435520172119, 0.9976880550384521, 0.6993561387062073, 0.9904592037200928, 0.6821271181106567, 0.8120991587638855, 0.9993361830711365, 0.7916263341903687, 0.8109512329101562, 0.9999996423721313, 0.5495225191116333, 0.6668601036071777, 0.5192357301712036, 0.9999942779541016, 0.48257356882095337, 0.9841594696044922, 0.9999979138374329, 0.6415997743606567, 0.9397159814834595, 0.18106287717819214, 0.8987319469451904, 0.9081076383590698, 0.3383346199989319, 0.8609538078308105, 0.9999992251396179, 0.5588356852531433, 0.7835736274719238, 0.9179232716560364, 0.999708890914917, 0.949955940246582, 0.9700540900230408, 0.9931137561798096, 0.3067934215068817, 0.3673347532749176, 0.7699087262153625, 0.9994036555290222, 0.9636306762695312, 0.999966025352478, 0.943821132183075, 0.9999387860298157, 0.9999590516090393, 0.9993442296981812, 0.9999996423721313, 0.7904483079910278, 0.9249926805496216, 0.39777877926826477, 0.9973591566085815, 0.9886971116065979, 0.996740996837616, 0.996508002281189, 0.7802301049232483, 0.9097115397453308, 0.9953480958938599, 0.9947166442871094, 0.6236841082572937, 0.4395410418510437, 0.9999999403953552, 0.6444871425628662, 0.9689194560050964, 0.3799087405204773, 0.9231736660003662, 0.8397600650787354, 0.9999915957450867, 0.679919958114624, 0.4723290801048279, 0.16538068652153015, 0.7191997170448303, 0.9359641075134277, 0.6034667491912842, 0.9927687048912048, 0.9953782558441162, 0.7468293309211731, 0.86815345287323, 0.9999962449073792, 0.9736114740371704, 0.5489122867584229, 0.9999982118606567, 0.9169776439666748, 0.9993374943733215, 0.9994250535964966, 0.5845405459403992, 0.8101097941398621, 0.7299942374229431, 0.40806037187576294, 0.7189463376998901, 0.4361906051635742, 0.8543539047241211, 0.9997495412826538, 0.595079243183136, 0.9047073125839233, 0.9910597205162048, 0.9999995231628418, 0.2478472888469696, 0.9917945265769958, 0.49351292848587036, 0.9083377122879028, 0.6796245574951172, 0.9999358057975769, 0.9993069171905518, 0.2791341245174408, 0.9935171008110046, 0.8271523714065552, 0.4515331983566284, 0.9999828934669495, 0.5910964608192444, 0.8788452744483948, 0.9986805319786072, 0.8003426790237427, 0.9967167973518372], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.5611367225646973}
