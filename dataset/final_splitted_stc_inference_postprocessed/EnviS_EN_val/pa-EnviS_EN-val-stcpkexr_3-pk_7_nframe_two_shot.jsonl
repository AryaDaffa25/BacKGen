From the manipulation of food production and labeling to the extraction of natural resources and the production of greenhouse gases, the negative impact on our planet and our well-being is alarming. The use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and synthetic materials, while presented as solutions, often lead to unintended consequences and health risks. The disregard for the environment and the exploitation of resources, particularly by the wealthy, contributes to the degradation of our natural world and the worsening of climate change. The reversal of environmental protection legislation and the promotion of industrial farming and fracking, under the guise of self-sufficiency, only exacerbates the problem.

Furthermore, the fear-mongering and misinformation spread about plant-based diets only adds to the confusion and makes it harder for individuals to make informed decisions. The lack of transparency and accountability in government policies, such as the forced implementation of three waters in New Zealand, further exacerbates the problem.

People's unwillingness to grasp the facts and instead rely on false narratives or outdated information is a major hindrance to progress and a threat to our future. The consequences of this ignorance can be devastating, from the destruction of our environment to the perpetuation of harmful practices. It's frustrating to see how some individuals refuse to listen to science and instead cling to their misconceptions, putting us all at risk.", "In the realm of commerce, affordability is a key factor in making choices. Renewable energy, such as solar power, is increasingly becoming a more cost-effective option compared to traditional energy sources.

The positive sentiment in the second background sentence supports this classification, as it also expresses the need for urgent action to address climate change.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "ne", "eds", "to", "'", "is", "a", "modal", "verb", "that", "express", "es", "necessity", "or", "obligation", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "it", "implies", "a", "sense", "of", "urg", "ency", "and", "importance", ".", "Given", "the", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", ",", "the", "pol", "arity", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "can", "be", "classified", "as", "'", "pos", "itive", "'.", "The", "reason", "for", "this", "classification", "is", "that", "the", "necessity", "or", "obligation", "being", "expressed", "is", "related", "to", "taking", "action", "to", "address", "a", "pressing", "issue", ",", "such", "as", "climate", "change", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", "does", "not", "directly", "affect", "the", "pol", "arity", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", ",", "as", "it", "is", "not", "express", "ing", "a", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "target", "phrase", "itself", ",", "but", "rather", "towards", "the", "in", "action", "and", "lack", "of", "urg", "ency", "displayed", "by", "some", "individuals", "and", "leaders", ".", "The", "positive", "sentiment", "in", "the", "second", "background", "sentence", "supports", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "it", "also", "express", "es", "the", "need", "for", "urgent", "action", "to", "address", "climate", "change", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9365484714508057, 0.6766237020492554, 0.5387070775032043, 0.9960752725601196, 0.9321475625038147, 0.9995765686035156, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9999970197677612, 0.9969149231910706, 0.33057451248168945, 0.2795179784297943, 0.5171645879745483, 0.9168635606765747, 0.27772286534309387, 0.30347728729248047, 0.9999370574951172, 0.6492069363594055, 0.6296575665473938, 0.5883183479309082, 0.8675261735916138, 0.46195176243782043, 0.5121469497680664, 0.9450702667236328, 0.9990683794021606, 0.7890097498893738, 0.3476164937019348, 0.6255090832710266, 0.9712693691253662, 0.9999939203262329, 0.9987689852714539, 0.9999982118606567, 0.7874192595481873, 0.66546231508255, 0.5146207213401794, 0.4486602246761322, 0.9438007473945618, 0.5678370594978333, 0.9287947416305542, 0.6070899963378906, 0.6747652292251587, 0.7401520013809204, 0.44915053248405457, 0.3068591058254242, 0.9999978542327881, 0.7846784591674805, 0.5142614841461182, 0.860956072807312, 0.9998539686203003, 0.4734058380126953, 0.9998053312301636, 0.9178869724273682, 0.9999643564224243, 0.9515570998191833, 0.8455060720443726, 0.9999992251396179, 0.7782964706420898, 0.5604751706123352, 0.15065880119800568, 0.339607298374176, 0.947806179523468, 0.6774184107780457, 0.9873818159103394, 0.9827699661254883, 0.9103545546531677, 0.24274802207946777, 0.8094747066497803, 0.9666689038276672, 0.4368150234222412, 0.9090198874473572, 0.510400652885437, 0.45818203687667847, 0.9999986290931702, 0.8080706000328064, 0.813750684261322, 0.5486040711402893, 0.9994286298751831, 0.6600548028945923, 0.7960723042488098, 0.9938435554504395, 0.7934237718582153, 0.29962122440338135, 0.9999783635139465, 0.9870756268501282, 0.9999843835830688, 0.7467724084854126, 0.47632232308387756, 0.368751585483551, 0.8596444725990295, 0.7230474948883057, 0.7438851594924927, 0.9187988638877869, 0.9909605979919434, 0.24654154479503632, 0.9990159273147583, 0.38252130150794983, 0.49739623069763184, 0.9865428805351257, 0.8283306360244751, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9157962799072266, 0.9742881655693054, 0.9992859959602356, 0.9998787641525269, 0.8351283669471741, 0.6286884546279907, 0.7221958637237549, 0.71556156873703, 0.3502997159957886, 0.35555127263069153, 0.997489869594574, 0.8652521967887878, 0.6979816555976868, 0.7031155824661255, 0.9582716822624207, 0.7517998814582825, 0.9956786036491394, 0.9936997890472412, 0.6529445648193359, 0.9998146891593933, 0.9733237624168396, 0.9178226590156555, 0.946036696434021, 0.48023152351379395, 0.997212290763855, 0.5434584021568298, 0.44252708554267883, 0.9999970197677612, 0.9615462422370911, 0.9999989867210388, 0.34821856021881104, 0.9988948702812195, 0.9824519753456116, 0.9993155002593994, 0.9970957636833191, 0.9991921782493591, 0.8453023433685303, 0.7611989378929138, 0.9736772775650024, 0.6872529983520508, 0.9103200435638428, 0.6574443578720093, 0.5600473284721375, 0.9318112134933472, 0.8918347358703613, 0.22346439957618713, 0.8550529479980469, 0.7737216353416443, 0.9598569869995117, 0.9942532181739807, 0.9977853894233704, 0.7505857348442078, 0.823427140712738, 0.9999982118606567, 0.9102268815040588, 0.5201147198677063, 0.9989451766014099, 0.9109286069869995, 0.9966939091682434, 0.8980439901351929, 0.9993413686752319, 0.6626626253128052, 0.999988853931427, 0.9682907462120056, 0.41661137342453003], "st_polarity_prediction": "positive", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.8455060720443726}

In this context, the background knowledge does not provide any clear indication of the sentiment towards GMOs. However, the negative sentiment expressed in the first background sentence, which mentions the manipulation of public opinion and the lack of transparency, could potentially influence the interpretation of the target phrase as a negative statement. This is because the rejection of GMOs could be seen as a response to perceived deception or manipulation by the industry promoting them. However, it's important to note that this interpretation is not definitive and that the sentiment towards GMOs can vary widely depending on individual beliefs and values.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n",

Meanwhile, factory farming, which is horrendously evil and cruel, is destroying the planet with climate change. The lack of concern for the welfare of non-human animals and the environment is truly disheartening. Furthermore, the misinformation spread about electric vehicles being environmentally friendly is grossly misinformed. The delay in creating affordable housing in liberal cities is a clear example of unsociable behavior. The violence in regions like Niger Republic is becoming more vicious and violent, interlinked with environmental stressors. The increasing air pollution is a dangerous situation, and if it is not reduced by 2030, it will be necessary to use oxygen kits to breathe without difficulty. The frequency of severe allergy attacks caused by peanut allergy is on the rise, and even tiny amounts of peanuts can cause a serious reaction that can be life-threat", "Sharing a commitment to the environment, no matter how small our individual impact, is a powerful bond that unites us all. This bond is strengthened by our choices, such as supporting naturally grown, non-GMO grains like sorghum, which not only benefits our health but also saves valuable resources like water.", "In today's world, where various changes are taking place, it's heartening to see individuals and organizations taking steps towards a more sustainable future. From investing in soil health to reducing waste, and from promoting efficient use of resources to focusing on renewable energy, there are numerous initiatives that are making a positive impact. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security.

For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security. Moreover, focusing on reusables and recycling, instead of just paying to dump rubbish, is a more sustainable and necessary approach to waste management. It's encouraging to see that individuals and organizations are recognizing the importance of these steps and taking action", "From the input texts, it's clear that many individuals and organizations are taking steps to make a positive impact on the environment and the world around them. Whether it's through reducing plastic pollution, developing sustainable agriculture, or creating more sustainable technologies, the commitment to making a difference is evident. For instance, reusing ten single-use plastics can halve plastic pollution in the ocean, and more sustainable and health tourism can be found in all countries. Some individuals are even going as far as buying up properties and contributing to sustainable agriculture and irrigation development in third world countries. Cultivated meat, which is the same meat we've always known and loved, is being crafted with care in a cultivator using plant protein to provide meat that is better for you and better for the planet.

For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security.

Despite the availability of clean and reliable energy sources like nuclear power, many continue to support and prioritize renewable energy, which is not only expensive but also detrimental to the climate. The exploitation of land and resources, as well as the introduction of genetically modified organisms, have led to the contamination of our food and water, causing diseases and health issues. The lack of awareness and education about the differences in food production and the importance of soil and plant science only adds to the problem. The situation is further complicated by the profit-driven green industry that thrives on the fear of a climate emergency, and the misuse of land and resources by governments and corporations. The future looks bleak as climate change continues to spiral out of control, and the support for unsustainable practices and policies only worsens the situation.", "The use of certain facilities and locations, such as prisons and farms, can lead to negative consequences and harm to individuals and communities. The poor quality of food in a prison in Bahrain has led to young detainees refusing meals due to budgetary constraints. This situation is a clear example of how the use of a facility can negatively impact the lives of those within it. Additionally, the existence of evil plantations and broken deals in certain locations, such as farms in Ukraine, can lead to pollution and other harmful practices. These issues can have far-reaching consequences and negatively impact the lives of those affected. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the potential negative consequences that can arise from the use of certain facilities and locations, and to take steps to mitigate these issues whenever possible.", "It's disheartening to see how certain individuals and groups are trying to force their beliefs and agendas upon others, disregarding personal freedom and democracy.

From comparing ministries to sewage systems, to intentionally releasing methane into the atmosphere for personal gain, the disregard for the natural world and its ecosystem services is alarming. These actions, if executed, would lead us down a dangerous path towards extinction, the opposite of defending nature.

Meanwhile, factory farming, which is horrendously evil and cruel, is destroying the planet with climate change. The lack of concern for the welfare of non-human animals and the environment is truly disheartening. Furthermore, the misinformation spread about electric vehicles being environmentally friendly is grossly misinformed. The delay in creating affordable housing in liberal cities is a clear example of unsociable behavior.

Therefore, the sentiment towards the term 'anti' in this context is negative, as it represents resistance or opposition to specific entities or practices.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "term", "'", "anti", "'", "implies", "opposition", "or", "resistance", "to", "something", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "Filip", "ino", "farmers", "are", "not", "inher", "ently", "against", "Gen", "et", "ically", "Mod", "ified", "Organ", "isms", "(", "G", "MO", "s", ")", "as", "a", "whole", ",", "but", "rather", "against", "specific", "G", "MO", "s", "owned", "by", "certain", "corporations", "that", "have", "negative", "impacts", "on", "their", "liv", "elihood", "s", ".", "The", "farmers", "'", "opposition", "is", "driven", "by", "concerns", "over", "cross", "cont", "amination", "and", "dependency", "on", "expensive", "GM", "seeds", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "term", "'", "anti", "'", "in", "this", "context", "is", "negative", ",", "as", "it", "represents", "resistance", "or", "opposition", "to", "specific", "entities", "or", "practices", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.927303671836853, 0.458008736371994, 0.9999951124191284, 0.4625912606716156, 0.7793174982070923, 0.9856023192405701, 0.999902606010437, 0.9999855756759644, 0.9958479404449463, 0.8349529504776001, 0.7079542279243469, 0.5427108407020569, 0.9874083399772644, 0.9996923804283142, 0.993412971496582, 0.1726081520318985, 0.8230448961257935, 0.719170093536377, 0.8355824947357178, 0.4460418224334717, 0.8443046808242798, 0.8543646931648254, 0.9176342487335205, 0.5912749767303467, 0.836787223815918, 0.9989446997642517, 0.6994727253913879, 0.9999976754188538, 0.9999865293502808, 0.8703675866127014, 0.2685869038105011, 0.3719494044780731, 0.9999929070472717, 0.6743527054786682, 0.4273681640625, 0.9970356822013855, 0.9999964237213135, 0.9991722106933594, 0.9999909996986389, 0.9997429847717285, 0.9998123645782471, 0.9975795745849609, 0.9999851584434509, 0.9999659657478333, 0.9996117949485779, 0.643409788608551, 0.5316066741943359, 0.9923650026321411, 0.782167375087738, 0.6366298198699951, 0.9697509407997131, 0.6919195652008057, 0.576047420501709, 0.8629015684127808, 0.7303627729415894, 0.9999605417251587, 0.9995823502540588, 0.40160995721817017, 0.9811140298843384, 0.6960145235061646, 0.9993770122528076, 0.41309666633605957, 0.48556390404701233, 0.4313574433326721, 0.6506209373474121, 0.9840381741523743, 0.7378218770027161, 0.4357147812843323, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9132811427116394, 0.6093228459358215, 0.3900446891784668, 0.24010500311851501, 0.8243589997291565, 0.47895321249961853, 0.3621465563774109, 0.3506297171115875, 0.9998573660850525, 0.558470606803894, 0.4604155719280243, 0.9538121819496155, 0.7885470986366272, 0.9999938607215881, 0.48870041966438293, 0.3357068598270416, 0.9889940023422241, 0.7802333831787109, 0.75783371925354, 0.99994957447052, 0.7416013479232788, 0.3637908101081848, 0.999915599822998, 0.9388110637664795, 0.49613574147224426, 0.44375622272491455, 0.7405946254730225, 0.8084180951118469, 0.9936167597770691, 0.9999250769615173, 0.9969107508659363, 0.5009518265724182, 0.8700045943260193, 0.8226505517959595, 0.9036458730697632, 0.9932034611701965, 0.47396335005760193, 0.9322247505187988, 0.9874159097671509, 0.484456866979599, 0.588340699672699, 0.9298558831214905, 0.9924923777580261, 0.5888354182243347, 0.6052260398864746, 0.9533531665802002, 0.7521432042121887, 0.9258995652198792, 0.9267615079879761, 0.8810378909111023], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.458008736371994}

In the context of the provided text, the excess refers to an overabundance of food safety measures.

The background knowledge also supports this interpretation, as it discusses various risks and threats to our well-being, including those related to food safety.

The positive examples, such as the beneficial effects of carbon dioxide and the transition to renewable energy, do not directly relate to the target phrase and should not be considered in the classification.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "word", "'", "likely", "'", "implies", "a", "probability", "of", "something", "happening", ".", "In", "the", "context", "of", "the", "provided", "text", ",", "it", "suggests", "that", "there", "may", "be", "issues", "with", "scal", "ability", "without", "industrial", "comp", "ost", "ing", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", ",", "such", "as", "the", "potential", "haz", "ards", "and", "negative", "consequences", ",", "the", "outrage", "over", "the", "removal", "of", "ve", "gan", "options", ",", "and", "the", "decision", "to", "keep", "re", "lying", "on", "foss", "il", "energy", ",", "further", "supports", "the", "classification", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "as", "negative", ".", "The", "positive", "examples", ",", "such", "as", "the", "beneficial", "effects", "of", "carbon", "dio", "x", "ide", "and", "the", "transition", "to", "renew", "able", "energy", ",", "do", "not", "directly", "relate", "to", "the", "target", "phrase", "and", "should", "not", "be", "considered", "in", "the", "classification", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9360938668251038, 0.5526989102363586, 0.9999992251396179, 0.4900301396846771, 0.8553986549377441, 0.9702155590057373, 0.9998833537101746, 0.9999678134918213, 0.9965723156929016, 0.9063189625740051, 0.8138477802276611, 0.6947579383850098, 0.9933115839958191, 0.9994146227836609, 0.999142587184906, 0.21135275065898895, 0.6056006550788879, 0.6552811861038208, 0.37105441093444824, 0.6812368035316467, 0.4976000487804413, 0.4825381934642792, 0.6374721527099609, 0.5520322322845459, 0.4476773738861084, 0.8169131875038147, 0.9407522678375244, 0.40267515182495117, 0.9426764845848083, 0.9945799112319946, 0.41592708230018616, 0.5337252616882324, 0.7609826326370239, 0.9715973138809204, 0.6030585765838623, 0.9983214735984802, 0.6869235038757324, 0.5319501757621765, 0.5374175310134888, 0.999991238117218, 0.46536892652511597, 0.9975495934486389, 0.9998814463615417, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9168365001678467, 0.4829731285572052, 0.30978941917419434, 0.9386906623840332, 0.5004400014877319, 0.8215410113334656, 0.9114040732383728, 0.9646421074867249, 0.22943995893001556, 0.8677024245262146, 0.24944964051246643, 0.5442031621932983, 0.9999921321868896, 0.40565958619117737, 0.25399160385131836, 0.7768623232841492, 0.9998729825019836, 0.4808056354522705, 0.7257046699523926, 0.999880850315094, 0.4693983793258667, 0.1487927883863449, 0.913914144039154, 0.5284743309020996, 0.5214869976043701, 0.6328824162483215, 0.9999979138374329, 0.5341318249702454, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9907278418540955, 0.9882020950317383, 0.9964264035224915, 0.9913864135742188, 0.25983572006225586, 0.9939849376678467, 0.49815642833709717, 0.9992038607597351, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9625711441040039, 1.0, 0.9993085861206055, 0.870754599571228, 0.16033311188220978, 0.3044956624507904, 0.916459858417511, 0.863914430141449, 0.9903615117073059, 0.5019608736038208, 0.9611170291900635, 0.9968289136886597, 0.930601954460144, 0.9399433135986328, 0.9902573227882385, 0.4488934278488159, 0.43169960379600525, 0.3898572623729706, 0.49213558435440063, 0.48252588510513306, 0.9999727010726929, 0.9659959673881531, 0.5431928634643555, 0.5478272438049316, 0.9999794363975525, 0.9923278093338013, 0.9999989867210388, 0.999991238117218, 0.9999955296516418, 0.8388433456420898, 0.9490951299667358, 0.44097036123275757, 0.9965216517448425, 0.9995698928833008, 1.0, 0.9999831318855286, 0.999211847782135, 0.8326230049133301, 0.9999920725822449, 0.333444207906723, 0.9361088275909424, 0.999998152256012, 0.9996261596679688, 0.637466311454773, 0.9998981952667236, 0.9418014883995056, 0.41670262813568115, 0.9996063113212585, 0.5082292556762695, 0.5342044830322266, 0.5937595963478088, 0.8028982877731323, 0.6600974202156067, 0.9910405278205872, 0.9459958076477051], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.5526989102363586}

From investing in soil health to reducing waste, and from promoting efficient use of resources to focusing on renewable energy, there are numerous initiatives that are making a positive impact. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security. Moreover, focusing on reusables and recycling, instead of just paying to dump rubbish, is a more sustainable and necessary approach to waste management. It's encouraging to see that individuals and organizations are recognizing the importance of these steps and taking action", "The human stories at the heart of environmental conflicts are located in various places, from the United Kingdom to real estate events and even our own backyards.

Whether it's through the adoption of organic foods, the development of new technologies, or the implementation of sustainable practices, the collective effort to make a positive impact is commendable. For instance, India's commitment to reducing its emission intensity by 24% in 11 years is a significant achievement, and the invention of the world's first dual waste collection truck is a step in the right direction towards minimizing plastic waste.

Unfortunately, investigations into the root causes of these issues are often inadequate or nonexistent, leaving us to suffer the consequences. In the case of environmental disasters like oil spills, the damage can be long-lasting and far-reaching, affecting entire regions and ecosystems. The situation is further complicated by the fact that these crises are often interconnected, making it difficult to address them in isolation. For instance, the conflict between herders and farmers in Niger Republic is not only a matter of resources but also a symptom of environmental stressors. Similarly, the blue-green algae bloom in Bass Lake Mactier is a reminder of the devastating impact that pollution can have on our water sources and the communities that depend on them.

For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security. Moreover, focusing on reusables and recycling, instead of just paying to dump rubbish, is a more sustainable and necessary approach to waste management. It's encouraging to see that individuals and organizations are recognizing the importance of these steps and taking action", "Making things better for the environment and for people is a positive and important goal.

The positive background sentence does not contradict this classification, as it focuses on individual actions to create a cleaner, more sustainable world, rather than providing a solution to the specific problem addressed in the text.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "no", "such", "thing", "'", "express", "es", "a", "lack", "or", "absence", "of", "something", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "it", "suggests", "that", "there", "is", "no", "viable", "solution", "or", "alternative", "to", "the", "problem", "at", "hand", ",", "which", "is", "'", "green", "mining", "via", "green", "consumer", "ism", "vs", "re", "using", "and", "repair", "ing", "'.", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", ",", "such", "as", "the", "persistent", "problem", "of", "blue", "-", "green", "al", "ga", "e", "blo", "oms", ",", "further", "supports", "the", "classification", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "as", "negative", ".", "The", "positive", "background", "sentence", "does", "not", "contrad", "ict", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "it", "focuses", "on", "individual", "actions", "to", "create", "a", "clean", "er", ",", "more", "sustainable", "world", ",", "rather", "than", "providing", "a", "solution", "to", "the", "specific", "problem", "addressed", "in", "the", "text", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9492042660713196, 0.48872748017311096, 0.9999990463256836, 0.4811244308948517, 0.8924838900566101, 0.9780415296554565, 0.9999231696128845, 0.9999915957450867, 0.9902554154396057, 0.8462315797805786, 0.8548325300216675, 0.5602933764457703, 0.9997778534889221, 0.7169266939163208, 0.9997545480728149, 0.9999973177909851, 0.9999839067459106, 0.9965442419052124, 0.2253999412059784, 0.9998718500137329, 0.5387871265411377, 0.7614032626152039, 0.9607743620872498, 0.5108127593994141, 0.5367372035980225, 0.959676206111908, 0.532558262348175, 0.595557689666748, 0.7942642569541931, 0.7248766422271729, 0.9975618720054626, 0.885731041431427, 0.39127233624458313, 0.952390730381012, 0.5263375639915466, 0.8414762616157532, 0.79661625623703, 0.5173675417900085, 0.6890429258346558, 0.8052994012832642, 0.4384021461009979, 0.8404870629310608, 0.8101810216903687, 0.645147442817688, 0.23574791848659515, 0.9999933838844299, 0.545685350894928, 0.6673622131347656, 0.6267271637916565, 0.717709481716156, 0.9955697655677795, 0.9998297691345215, 0.8257627487182617, 0.9994433522224426, 0.9998927116394043, 0.9999983906745911, 0.8927350640296936, 0.9951139092445374, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9999976754188538, 0.9998608231544495, 0.9999999403953552, 0.8590431809425354, 0.455678790807724, 0.42533615231513977, 0.957018256187439, 0.41914838552474976, 0.8746058940887451, 0.6865145564079285, 0.9454119205474854, 0.24761554598808289, 0.22236953675746918, 0.9999929666519165, 0.9194727540016174, 0.16469866037368774, 0.6682847142219543, 0.9653785228729248, 0.7684449553489685, 0.9999208450317383, 0.9999021291732788, 0.999984860420227, 0.9993103742599487, 0.9999969005584717, 0.9309279918670654, 0.999683678150177, 0.3977450728416443, 0.2006058245897293, 0.460133820772171, 0.7579206824302673, 0.7685917019844055, 0.8060587048530579, 0.44335615634918213, 0.9763372540473938, 0.9997551441192627, 0.9978887438774109, 0.9673848748207092, 0.898026704788208, 0.6050026416778564, 0.7803364396095276, 0.7102236151695251, 0.34565815329551697, 0.2708439826965332, 0.9922158718109131, 0.3981141746044159, 0.999997079372406, 0.5089461803436279, 0.6270498633384705, 0.6117040514945984, 0.9391260147094727, 0.9290218949317932, 0.18362325429916382, 0.9995617866516113, 0.5308732986450195, 0.9878485202789307, 0.47373852133750916, 0.5546848177909851, 0.999250054359436, 0.8781251311302185, 0.999989926815033, 0.8117547631263733, 0.9901272654533386, 0.9999964237213135, 0.999869704246521, 0.729976236820221, 0.7549843788146973, 0.9999913573265076, 0.33098652958869934, 0.8079091310501099, 0.5771244168281555, 0.9128211736679077, 0.8421075940132141, 0.8519498705863953, 0.5582395792007446, 0.34618425369262695, 0.9297224283218384, 0.999866247177124, 0.5344052314758301, 0.9977144598960876, 0.9771379232406616], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.48872748017311096}

Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase 'supposedly' is negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "word", "'", "supp", "osed", "ly", "'", "implies", "doubt", "or", "uncertainty", "about", "the", "truth", "or", "accuracy", "of", "the", "statement", "that", "follows", "it", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "it", "suggests", "that", "the", "e", "co", "entrepreneur", "ial", "business", "models", "being", "described", "may", "not", "truly", "be", "as", "green", "as", "they", "claim", ".", "Given", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "associated", "with", "the", "background", "knowledge", "about", "individuals", "'", "waste", "ful", "habits", "and", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "constant", "flow", "of", "un", "att", "ribut", "ed", "information", ",", "it", "is", "reasonable", "to", "assume", "that", "the", "speaker", "is", "express", "ing", "ske", "ptic", "ism", "or", "dis", "bel", "ief", "about", "the", "authentic", "ity", "of", "these", "business", "models", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "pol", "arity", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "'", "supp", "osed", "ly", "'", "is", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9698014259338379, 0.47659018635749817, 0.9999982118606567, 0.45614728331565857, 0.7396606206893921, 0.9786965250968933, 0.9999173283576965, 0.9999807476997375, 0.9944183826446533, 0.8260687589645386, 0.8520854115486145, 0.6269833445549011, 0.9937121272087097, 0.9998624920845032, 0.9999912977218628, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9985479116439819, 0.2208862006664276, 0.5154086947441101, 0.8677241206169128, 0.3857027292251587, 0.3742978572845459, 0.9401849508285522, 0.8262718319892883, 0.45392629504203796, 0.4565269947052002, 0.9996349215507507, 0.3471671938896179, 0.4874987304210663, 0.5511260628700256, 0.802298367023468, 0.5129417777061462, 0.9334436655044556, 0.6714289784431458, 0.7752193808555603, 0.8217658996582031, 0.999057948589325, 0.5282352566719055, 0.5716114640235901, 0.661909818649292, 0.8050540089607239, 0.5336273312568665, 0.9999991655349731, 0.6103785634040833, 0.9999379515647888, 0.998879611492157, 0.9993869066238403, 0.3959203362464905, 0.35716795921325684, 0.6258379817008972, 0.996960461139679, 0.45669177174568176, 0.968363881111145, 0.39030492305755615, 0.44055986404418945, 0.48067688941955566, 0.9845081567764282, 0.6444535851478577, 0.4613215923309326, 0.46050330996513367, 0.9704346656799316, 0.8410477042198181, 0.8555923104286194, 0.3147042691707611, 0.9998108744621277, 0.5201439261436462, 0.7446878552436829, 0.8762988448143005, 0.2951852083206177, 0.6042623519897461, 0.6012776494026184, 0.2882530093193054, 0.9996618628501892, 0.9982565641403198, 0.6677979826927185, 0.700594425201416, 0.20013092458248138, 0.3377959132194519, 0.5048410296440125, 0.30785122513771057, 0.9169045686721802, 0.9980903267860413, 0.9999265670776367, 0.8872864842414856, 0.9907310009002686, 0.9998840689659119, 0.999999463558197, 0.9308463335037231, 0.9700255990028381, 0.6754209995269775, 0.39767929911613464, 0.6421688795089722, 0.9999635219573975, 0.662307858467102, 0.9588632583618164, 0.8702042698860168, 0.4922455847263336, 0.6248546242713928, 0.8873130679130554, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9715631008148193, 0.9999939203262329, 0.9999989867210388, 0.5889081954956055, 0.2853097915649414, 0.9558860063552856, 0.9999983310699463, 0.4940842390060425, 0.6835361123085022, 0.5229792594909668, 0.9983019828796387, 0.9976636171340942, 0.7373680472373962, 0.5283685326576233, 0.99552321434021, 0.8147889375686646, 0.5838087201118469, 0.9999803900718689, 0.9874239563941956, 0.5644660592079163, 0.9999986290931702, 0.9399879574775696, 0.9036561250686646, 0.9612773060798645, 0.9997417330741882, 0.778364360332489, 0.9999903440475464, 0.9999947547912598, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9999043941497803, 0.940949559211731, 0.8084766864776611, 0.9903138875961304, 0.9818722605705261], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.47659018635749817}

It is disheartening to see the disregard for the well-being of both non-human animals and the environment, and the continued pursuit of profit over preservation.", "The widespread consumption of genetically modified foods and other unhealthy ingredients, pushed by powerful figures and corporations, is a major concern for many. These substances, often produced with harmful chemicals and under questionable labor practices, are causing health issues and environmental damage. The lack of transparency and regulation in the food industry, as well as the prioritization of profits over people's well-being, is a significant problem that needs to be addressed.

For instance, India's commitment to reducing its emission intensity by 24% in 11 years is a significant achievement, and the invention of the world's first dual waste collection truck is a step in the right direction towards minimizing plastic waste. Additionally, the transformation of companies from producing biofuels to making nutraceuticals and other high-value products demonstrates the potential for innovation and adaptation in response to changing needs and priorities.
