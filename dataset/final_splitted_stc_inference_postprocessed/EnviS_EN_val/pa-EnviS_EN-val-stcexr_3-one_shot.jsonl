Therefore, while the word 'problems' itself is neutral, the context in which it is used in the text suggests a negative sentiment.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "word", "'", "pro", "ble", "ms", "'", "in", "the", "target", "phrase", "is", "neutral", "in", "nature", "as", "it", "simply", "refers", "to", "issues", "or", "difficulties", ".", "However", ",", "the", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", "as", "a", "whole", "seems", "to", "be", "negative", ",", "as", "it", "discuss", "es", "the", "cost", "of", "living", "crisis", "and", "the", "slow", "decline", "of", "medical", "care", ".", "The", "examples", "provided", "also", "illustr", "ate", "this", ",", "with", "the", "first", "example", "express", "ing", "a", "sense", "of", "loss", "and", "the", "second", "example", "advoc", "ating", "for", "investment", "in", "green", "technology", "to", "address", "climate", "change", ".", "Therefore", ",", "while", "the", "word", "'", "pro", "ble", "ms", "'", "itself", "is", "neutral", ",", "the", "context", "in", "which", "it", "is", "used", "in", "the", "text", "suggests", "a", "negative", "sentiment", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8911508917808533, 0.7177925705909729, 0.4524872601032257, 0.9925158619880676, 0.9999383687973022, 0.9999783635139465, 1.0, 0.9988267421722412, 0.5337986350059509, 0.7717823386192322, 0.3133707046508789, 0.9652849435806274, 0.4705145061016083, 0.5874585509300232, 0.48435020446777344, 0.20639479160308838, 0.4999222159385681, 0.9978626370429993, 0.28565314412117004, 0.8549273610115051, 0.9999955296516418, 0.7077722549438477, 0.9655609726905823, 0.8119001388549805, 0.656218409538269, 0.5689840316772461, 0.9999886751174927, 0.7822942137718201, 0.4908316135406494, 0.8619210720062256, 0.9993264675140381, 0.4668805003166199, 0.4481959044933319, 0.9998247027397156, 0.9999986886978149, 0.31828153133392334, 0.9750159382820129, 0.6918538808822632, 0.5768153667449951, 0.5126407146453857, 0.7666971683502197, 0.7634567618370056, 0.5394570827484131, 0.9999976754188538, 0.9395981431007385, 0.5350766777992249, 0.9998864531517029, 0.9999979138374329, 0.9999881982803345, 0.938304603099823, 0.955155611038208, 0.6305046081542969, 0.9928658604621887, 0.9987273216247559, 0.9987412691116333, 0.9999895095825195, 0.6716126799583435, 0.4760967195034027, 0.3337252736091614, 0.6676953434944153, 0.716816782951355, 0.1969960629940033, 0.9999807476997375, 0.5854377150535583, 0.7956112027168274, 0.8409385681152344, 0.6293321847915649, 0.7151650190353394, 0.8278812170028687, 0.45882946252822876, 0.9999556541442871, 0.8345015048980713, 0.7524428963661194, 0.999991774559021, 0.9922783970832825, 0.782336413860321, 0.6977918744087219, 0.9982485771179199, 0.5030441284179688, 0.23002149164676666, 0.9999989867210388, 0.99972003698349, 0.5541200041770935, 0.8272905945777893, 0.44791996479034424, 0.9133216738700867, 0.6138681769371033, 0.6765606999397278, 0.8444838523864746, 0.9953297972679138, 0.6982315182685852, 0.20637598633766174, 0.9999974966049194, 0.590813934803009, 0.5724267363548279, 0.6284940838813782, 0.9624501466751099, 0.9999916553497314, 0.9999903440475464, 1.0, 0.999995768070221, 0.9812913537025452, 0.9841232895851135, 0.9701739549636841, 0.9989468455314636, 0.9593708515167236, 0.3401331901550293, 0.6774309873580933, 0.9983468055725098, 0.9998944997787476, 0.7921853065490723, 0.9994940161705017, 0.5577812194824219, 0.9351370930671692, 0.5559096932411194, 0.46094250679016113, 0.993950605392456, 0.9995218515396118, 0.9549790620803833, 0.9891583919525146, 0.783286988735199], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.5874585509300232}

Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase is negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "phrase", "'", "most", "la", "x", "regulation", "'", "implies", "a", "lack", "of", "strict", "ness", "or", "control", ",", "which", "is", "generally", "considered", "a", "negative", "trait", ",", "especially", "when", "it", "comes", "to", "the", "use", "of", "chemicals", "or", "p", "estic", "ides", ".", "The", "context", "of", "the", "sentence", "also", "supports", "this", "interpretation", ",", "as", "it", "ment", "ions", "'", "d", "anger", "ous", "chemicals", "banned", "in", "other", "countries", "'", "and", "'", "l", "ax", "regulation", "of", "p", "estic", "ide", "use", "in", "the", "western", "world", "'.", "These", "phrases", "suggest", "that", "there", "are", "concerns", "about", "the", "safety", "and", "environmental", "impact", "of", "the", "chemicals", "being", "used", ",", "and", "that", "the", "regulations", "in", "place", "are", "not", "doing", "enough", "to", "address", "these", "concerns", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "pol", "arity", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "is", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8697103261947632, 0.5574518442153931, 0.9999982118606567, 0.5016556978225708, 0.6968356370925903, 0.9852580428123474, 0.9999783635139465, 0.9999868869781494, 0.9993301033973694, 0.804302990436554, 0.8686937689781189, 0.3980616629123688, 0.8231241106987, 0.9959049224853516, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9999986290931702, 0.9981875419616699, 0.9997410178184509, 0.4558987021446228, 0.6442712545394897, 0.9384585022926331, 0.9893456697463989, 0.3159458637237549, 0.7971076965332031, 0.9421642422676086, 0.2476077526807785, 0.5362111330032349, 0.7832784652709961, 0.5715261101722717, 0.5691568851470947, 0.7698026299476624, 0.6657038927078247, 0.9983289837837219, 0.262594074010849, 0.5288646817207336, 0.7688341736793518, 0.7523843050003052, 0.9172527194023132, 0.9715968370437622, 0.9999995231628418, 0.745270311832428, 0.9585589170455933, 0.9994507431983948, 0.383960485458374, 0.3135702311992645, 0.916271984577179, 0.9999907612800598, 0.9999877214431763, 0.5019079446792603, 0.5951814651489258, 0.18241170048713684, 0.8448624610900879, 0.9937987327575684, 0.5708168148994446, 0.4808494746685028, 0.27811065316200256, 0.9569980502128601, 0.8017129898071289, 0.9333509206771851, 0.9684817790985107, 0.989747941493988, 0.8382333517074585, 1.0, 0.4888575077056885, 0.998283863067627, 0.999987006187439, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9989882111549377, 0.6307516098022461, 0.9999387264251709, 0.9999991655349731, 0.999991238117218, 0.4802945852279663, 0.9668800234794617, 0.46909430623054504, 0.4559178352355957, 0.999123752117157, 0.9971209764480591, 0.8280201554298401, 0.9999722242355347, 0.9999916553497314, 0.9999982118606567, 0.9999886155128479, 0.69778972864151, 0.9999873042106628, 0.9985145330429077, 0.9999960064888, 0.6561364531517029, 0.31770509481430054, 0.7270509600639343, 0.705449640750885, 0.8742008209228516, 0.8009217381477356, 0.6551419496536255, 0.5153294801712036, 0.9961232542991638, 0.8546127676963806, 0.9861590266227722, 0.8420373201370239, 0.57480788230896, 0.9763094186782837, 0.9999997019767761, 0.8316818475723267, 0.7134050130844116, 0.5899753570556641, 0.9998766183853149, 0.7785879969596863, 0.959416389465332, 0.5618815422058105, 0.9427046179771423, 0.6099593043327332, 0.6181499361991882, 0.9128215909004211, 0.9569453597068787, 0.9909024238586426, 0.5290732383728027, 0.9998440742492676, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9641250371932983, 0.8085987567901611, 0.9991926550865173, 0.9997779130935669, 0.5378046631813049, 0.9999974966049194, 0.9291136860847473, 0.574833869934082, 0.9999982118606567, 0.9979403018951416, 0.9794124960899353, 0.9498032331466675, 0.9999451637268066, 0.506748616695404, 0.72884202003479, 0.9967218041419983, 0.9636436104774475], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.5574518442153931}

The examples provided also support this classification, as the sentiment towards 'contamination' is negative, and the positive sentiment towards 'reduce reuse recycle' does not contradict the negative sentiment towards the target phrase in the text.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "phrase", "'", "liter", "ally", "anything", "'", "in", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", "implies", "a", "sense", "of", "frustration", "and", "helpless", "ness", "towards", "the", "current", "issues", "in", "Mont", "ana", ".", "The", "author", "is", "express", "ing", "disappointment", "that", "the", "individuals", "in", "question", "are", "not", "addressing", "the", "pressing", "issues", "in", "their", "state", ",", "instead", "focusing", "on", "an", "issue", "that", "does", "not", "directly", "concern", "them", ".", "The", "use", "of", "the", "word", "'", "liter", "ally", "'", "emphas", "izes", "the", "all", "-", "en", "compass", "ing", "nature", "of", "the", "problems", "Mont", "an", "ans", "are", "facing", ",", "and", "the", "author", "'", "s", "sentiment", "towards", "these", "issues", "is", "negative", ".", "The", "examples", "provided", "also", "support", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "the", "sentiment", "towards", "'", "cont", "amination", "'", "is", "negative", ",", "and", "the", "positive", "sentiment", "towards", "'", "reduce", "re", "use", "rec", "ycle", "'", "does", "not", "contrad", "ict", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "target", "phrase", "in", "the", "text", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9097694754600525, 0.6645449995994568, 0.9999973177909851, 0.4168912470340729, 0.7891573309898376, 0.9877636432647705, 0.9999873638153076, 0.9999933838844299, 0.9992712736129761, 0.8454465866088867, 0.8709357380867004, 0.45128461718559265, 0.9049088954925537, 0.9891413450241089, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9999838471412659, 0.8159326314926147, 0.40656229853630066, 0.8907719850540161, 0.34816697239875793, 0.8394926190376282, 0.9648023843765259, 0.5313262343406677, 0.28825074434280396, 0.8616129159927368, 0.6346622109413147, 0.9999236464500427, 0.8937533497810364, 0.570875346660614, 0.35840368270874023, 0.9999921321868896, 0.5669686794281006, 0.9826192259788513, 0.27064308524131775, 0.7099605798721313, 0.46591615676879883, 0.999300479888916, 0.9999976754188538, 0.471737802028656, 0.8199540972709656, 0.16469670832157135, 0.5095788240432739, 0.8356468677520752, 0.9999968409538269, 0.45742008090019226, 0.6818674206733704, 0.9484925866127014, 0.4290144741535187, 0.6414498686790466, 0.9930726289749146, 0.5554629564285278, 0.5216280817985535, 0.6999419927597046, 0.36971890926361084, 0.6843425035476685, 0.3576771020889282, 0.7067009806632996, 0.5430212020874023, 0.6787095069885254, 0.8053682446479797, 0.4084443747997284, 0.896187961101532, 0.9355775713920593, 0.5147050619125366, 0.516815185546875, 0.8234039545059204, 0.8283675312995911, 0.9999490976333618, 0.721421480178833, 0.5466451644897461, 0.7281288504600525, 0.9598961472511292, 0.583437979221344, 0.5131357312202454, 0.9999894499778748, 0.7610552906990051, 0.5715763568878174, 0.9998347163200378, 0.6746740341186523, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9991413354873657, 0.5000720620155334, 0.9972233772277832, 0.9755234122276306, 0.4922165274620056, 0.9995289444923401, 0.9990585446357727, 0.9994571805000305, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9530172348022461, 0.9999070167541504, 0.9011300802230835, 0.42984893918037415, 0.2960480749607086, 0.9810851216316223, 0.9999740719795227, 0.840004563331604, 0.980259895324707, 0.6570501327514648, 0.5167023539543152, 0.8839498162269592, 0.29220378398895264, 0.9924370050430298, 0.9999929666519165, 0.2519262433052063, 0.829561710357666, 0.7621274590492249, 0.8849564790725708, 0.9840216636657715, 0.9717890024185181, 0.8898381590843201, 0.2738809287548065, 0.3153054416179657, 0.8605757355690002, 0.3590068221092224, 0.21268783509731293, 0.7592436671257019, 0.7121026515960693, 0.7642289996147156, 0.7015888690948486, 0.36160802841186523, 0.31798991560935974, 0.5241525769233704, 0.37883803248405457, 0.9493945240974426, 0.9999907612800598, 0.9973388910293579, 0.6201640367507935, 0.9667321443557739, 0.5144132971763611, 0.4177294671535492, 0.5118202567100525, 0.2098229080438614, 0.981552243232727, 0.9409990310668945, 0.9865849614143372, 0.9889877438545227, 0.5784745812416077, 0.999994695186615, 0.9997218251228333, 0.999984860420227, 0.9998643398284912, 0.5410466194152832, 0.9998670816421509, 0.40898704528808594, 0.9999969005584717, 0.8910702466964722, 0.41579633951187134, 0.8798189759254456, 0.519723653793335, 0.8996145129203796, 0.5859651565551758, 0.9998727440834045, 0.6519752740859985, 0.9298219680786133, 0.8482369780540466, 0.9992161989212036, 0.9880651235580444], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.6645449995994568}

It does not carry a positive or negative sentiment on its own. The text is discussing the Green Gas Support Scheme, which is a government initiative to support the production and use of biomethane as a renewable energy source.

The speaker is expressing their dissatisfaction with the customer service policy, which they find unusual and restrictive.

However, the context in which it is used in the target phrase can provide some clues. In this case, the phrase 'Filipino farmers aren't anti-GMO per se' suggests that the farmers have valid concerns about certain aspects of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and are not uniformly opposed to them. The rest of the sentence explains that their opposition is directed towards specific GMOs owned by corporations and TNCs that cause cross-contamination and burden them with dependency on GM seeds.\n\nTherefore, the word 'anti' in this context does not imply an unreasonable or negative stance against GMOs in general. Instead, it reflects a cautious and informed position taken by farmers who are concerned about the potential risks and negative impacts of certain GMOs.\n\nSo, the polarity of the target phrase 'anti' in this context is neutral. However, it's important to note that the sentiment of the overall sentence is positive, as it acknowledges the farmers' valid concerns and their desire to protect their crops and livelihoods.</s>",

Ultimately, the polarity of the target phrase should be classified as positive, as it represents a shift towards prioritizing the benefits of climate action over the costs.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "stop", "focusing", "on", "costs", "'", "implies", "a", "shift", "away", "from", "considering", "the", "financial", "implications", "of", "climate", "action", ".", "This", "can", "be", "seen", "as", "a", "positive", "step", ",", "as", "it", "suggests", "a", "move", "towards", "prior", "it", "izing", "the", "benefits", "of", "climate", "action", "over", "the", "costs", ".", "However", ",", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", "is", "mixed", ",", "as", "it", "acknowled", "ges", "that", "people", "may", "be", "reluct", "ant", "to", "take", "action", "if", "it", "requires", "significant", "financial", "sacrifice", "or", "lifestyle", "changes", ".", "Therefore", ",", "while", "the", "target", "phrase", "itself", "is", "positive", ",", "the", "context", "in", "which", "it", "appears", "may", "lead", "some", "to", "interpret", "it", "as", "negative", ",", "depending", "on", "their", "perspective", ".", "Ult", "imately", ",", "the", "pol", "arity", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "should", "be", "classified", "as", "positive", ",", "as", "it", "represents", "a", "shift", "towards", "prior", "it", "izing", "the", "benefits", "of", "climate", "action", "over", "the", "costs", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9364616274833679, 0.5202904939651489, 0.7111067771911621, 0.9999161958694458, 0.8104095458984375, 0.9998497366905212, 0.9999852776527405, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9999976754188538, 0.9998018741607666, 0.24954620003700256, 0.8158321380615234, 0.8792672157287598, 0.5842469930648804, 0.9999820590019226, 0.6477746963500977, 0.7226316332817078, 0.7250335812568665, 0.5291221141815186, 0.8890593647956848, 0.6220316290855408, 0.9860532283782959, 0.5759726762771606, 0.46776703000068665, 0.3018818497657776, 0.993669331073761, 0.7313273549079895, 0.9990243315696716, 0.9924533367156982, 0.7875223755836487, 0.43625205755233765, 0.36194533109664917, 0.9940319061279297, 0.8924105763435364, 0.5593718886375427, 0.9603012204170227, 0.2847368121147156, 0.9968252182006836, 0.7314867377281189, 0.9999895095825195, 0.9982240796089172, 0.9919344782829285, 0.925440788269043, 0.9561948776245117, 0.8186935782432556, 0.9999675154685974, 0.6315690279006958, 0.8099017143249512, 0.7694939374923706, 0.8708826899528503, 0.776826798915863, 0.9999989867210388, 0.5568099021911621, 0.25269457697868347, 0.7393493056297302, 0.9255513548851013, 0.9998036623001099, 0.9257172346115112, 0.4435179829597473, 0.16248948872089386, 0.8875102400779724, 0.7025965452194214, 0.7809917330741882, 0.7719258666038513, 0.9999995231628418, 0.8265036940574646, 0.7478792071342468, 0.963524341583252, 0.6732136607170105, 0.5638904571533203, 0.999999463558197, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9157346487045288, 0.9168747067451477, 0.8520569801330566, 0.9999173879623413, 0.825065016746521, 0.9915943741798401, 0.9602132439613342, 0.47151312232017517, 0.6500954627990723, 0.8312731981277466, 0.9979156255722046, 0.9990140795707703, 0.7349457144737244, 0.9999951124191284, 0.7399935722351074, 0.8955326676368713, 0.9524404406547546, 0.9998717308044434, 0.9842981696128845, 0.8773826360702515, 0.9724879264831543, 0.9961944818496704, 0.7384035587310791, 0.4325708746910095, 0.7560288310050964, 0.9999851584434509, 0.9999997019767761, 0.8308804035186768, 0.3890354335308075, 0.3108782172203064, 0.9974626302719116, 0.7208127975463867, 0.5712371468544006, 0.9628581404685974, 0.6614331007003784, 0.9668910503387451, 0.5771484971046448, 0.8108574151992798, 0.9999687671661377, 0.9997603893280029, 0.9549745321273804, 0.6676644086837769, 0.7192960381507874, 0.9999896883964539, 0.9999973177909851, 0.9012190103530884, 0.5904057025909424, 0.999998152256012, 0.8954726457595825, 0.9296054840087891, 0.9838270545005798, 0.9998895525932312, 0.6371631622314453, 0.9969794154167175, 0.5486878752708435, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9523331522941589, 0.8340257406234741, 0.9859237670898438, 0.9951127767562866, 0.5024186372756958, 0.9939976334571838, 0.37694719433784485, 0.9279934167861938, 0.5976089835166931, 0.9999847412109375, 0.9999873042106628, 0.9952199459075928, 0.9663146138191223, 0.9984277486801147, 0.9998888373374939, 0.9999942183494568, 0.6876460313796997, 0.8965703248977661, 0.9988337755203247, 0.958567202091217, 0.9716776013374329], "st_polarity_prediction": "positive", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.7875223755836487}

The reason for this classification is that the term 'co benefits' is often used to refer to the additional advantages or positive outcomes that come along with a particular action or policy. In the context of climate action, the 'co benefits' can include improved public health, increased energy independence, job creation, and economic growth, among others. Therefore, the use of the term 'co benefits' in the text suggests a positive outlook towards climate action and its potential benefits.\n\nExplanation:\nThe text expresses a sentiment that people may be hesitant to take action to reduce their carbon footprint due to cost concerns and extreme lifestyle changes. However, the text also emphasizes the importance of focusing on the 'huge number of co benefits' of climate action instead of just the costs. This shift in focus towards the benefits of climate action indicates a positive sentiment towards the issue.

Therefore, the output should be 'neutral'.\n\nExplanation:\nThe word 'increase' itself does not have a definitive positive or negative connotation. It can be used to describe a variety of situations, some of which may be positive and some negative. In the given text, the context is not clear enough to determine the sentiment of the phrase 'increase'. Therefore, the safest and most accurate output would be 'neutral'.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "word", "'", "in", "cre", "ase", "'", "generally", "has", "a", "positive", "con", "notation",

The phrase implies that according to Gates, livestock farming is a contributor to climate change, which is a viewpoint that some people may disagree with or find unfavorable.

Therefore, the negative sentiment associated with the phrase 'biggest threat' outweighs the positive sentiment in the text as a whole, leading to the classification of 'negative' for the target phrase.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "big", "gest", "threat", "'", "is", "classified", "as", "negative", ".", "The", "reason", "for", "this", "classification", "is", "that", "the", "phrase", "'", "big", "gest", "threat", "'", "implies", "a", "danger", "or", "harm", ",", "which", "is", "typically", "associated", "with", "a", "negative", "sentiment", ".", "The", "examples", "provided", "also", "support", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "the", "word", "'", "gent", "r", "ified", "'", "in", "example", "", "1", "has", "a", "negative", "sentiment", ",", "indicating", "a", "change", "that", "displ", "aces", "or", "neg", "atively", "impacts", "a", "community", ".", "The", "word", "'", "re", "cycle", "'", "in", "example", "", "2", ",", "on", "the", "other", "hand", ",", "has", "a", "positive", "sentiment", ",", "indicating", "an", "action", "that", "is", "beneficial", "for", "the", "environment", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "associated", "with", "the", "phrase", "'", "big", "gest", "threat", "'", "out", "we", "igh", "s", "the", "positive", "sentiment", "in", "the", "text", "as", "a", "whole", ",", "leading", "to", "the", "classification", "of", "'", "negative", "'", "for", "the", "target", "phrase", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9121107459068298, 0.5884524583816528, 0.7949046492576599, 0.9997373819351196, 0.8938404321670532, 0.9993255138397217, 0.9999979138374329, 0.9998403191566467, 0.9998465180397034, 0.31370097398757935, 0.53592848777771, 0.9999208450317383, 0.5741326808929443, 0.7613540887832642, 0.3698720335960388, 0.378356009721756, 0.3715970516204834, 0.9479119777679443, 0.8870494961738586, 0.9942572116851807, 0.9550698399543762, 0.5659154653549194, 0.44272056221961975, 0.6823804378509521, 0.9430059790611267, 0.9998995065689087, 0.9998253583908081, 0.9999794960021973, 0.237772136926651, 0.6006141901016235, 0.4034997224807739, 0.6906474232673645, 0.7733033895492554, 0.3466792702674866, 0.5539790391921997, 0.8680968880653381, 0.3893575072288513, 0.5424187183380127, 0.9999935626983643, 0.5440466403961182, 0.9998186230659485, 0.997237503528595, 0.984704315662384, 0.45260870456695557, 0.3145667016506195, 0.7198019027709961, 0.4272383451461792, 0.6051684617996216, 0.9964994192123413, 0.8993087410926819, 0.7039468288421631, 0.7797021865844727, 0.519588828086853, 0.6221141815185547, 0.9991960525512695, 0.997601330280304, 0.9999861717224121, 0.9959259629249573, 0.9328622817993164, 0.5762513279914856, 0.6438244581222534, 0.9526746869087219, 0.9999877214431763, 0.4226827323436737, 0.9995310306549072, 0.9941426515579224, 0.9731138944625854, 0.3365969955921173, 0.32695820927619934, 0.6896117329597473, 0.4445020258426666, 0.7491661310195923, 0.25685250759124756, 0.9832093119621277, 0.8600680828094482, 0.480349600315094, 0.9999859929084778, 0.6824434399604797, 0.4465126097202301, 0.9708142280578613, 0.9023628234863281, 0.3175334632396698, 0.4276879131793976, 0.9985218644142151, 0.9798333644866943, 0.9993661642074585, 0.9993348717689514, 0.9998672604560852, 0.9966809749603271, 0.9999921321868896, 0.9999738335609436, 0.8814423680305481, 0.9656218886375427, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999868273735046, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9769123196601868, 0.9999505281448364, 0.9997270703315735, 0.9999238848686218, 0.9538888931274414, 0.5529585480690002, 0.7966920137405396, 0.5709710121154785, 0.9911757707595825, 0.5479529500007629, 0.7594089508056641, 0.6189130544662476, 0.9992998838424683, 0.9999827146530151, 0.5671274662017822, 0.3002683222293854, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9768760204315186, 0.42450734972953796, 0.9611395001411438, 0.823593258857727, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9076966047286987, 0.6331306099891663, 0.9999892115592957, 0.9998303055763245, 0.9993880391120911, 0.9999688267707825, 0.9999895095825195, 0.7175856232643127, 0.9999434947967529, 0.9999666213989258, 0.9999976754188538, 0.5513272881507874, 0.9924323558807373, 0.9940685033798218, 0.6597462296485901, 0.8636467456817627, 0.3228873014450073, 0.782433032989502, 0.9999896287918091, 0.9999997019767761, 0.7226729393005371, 0.6545707583427429, 0.9979342222213745, 0.705863893032074, 0.921600878238678, 0.9872215986251831, 0.610192596912384, 0.9835149645805359, 0.6939229369163513, 0.9392439126968384, 0.9904905557632446, 0.9971325993537903, 0.9999247193336487, 0.9926226139068604, 0.9811846613883972], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.5741326808929443}

However, the overall sentiment of the sentences is determined by the surrounding context and the meaning of the individual words, not the neutral target phrases themselves.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "w", "ants", "a", "bigger", "piece", "of", "this", "market", "'", "is", "a", "neutral", "statement", ".", "It", "does", "not", "express", "any", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "action", "or", "the", "market", ".", "The", "phrase", "simply", "indicates", "a", "desire", "or", "intention", "to", "increase", "participation", "in", "a", "market", ".", "The", "examples", "provided", "do", "not", "directly", "influence", "the", "classification", ",", "but", "they", "demonstrate", "that", "neutral", "statements", "can", "exist", "in", "both", "positive", "and", "negative", "context", "s", ".", "In", "the", "first", "example", ",", "the", "neutral", "statement", "'", "sets", "the", "ocean", "outside", "born", "holm", "on", "fire", "'", "is", "part", "of", "a", "negative", "sentence", ",", "while", "in", "the", "second", "example", ",", "the", "neutral", "statement", "'", "does", "not", "produce", "ongoing", "pollution", "'", "is", "part", "of", "a", "positive", "sentence", ".", "However", ",", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "of", "the", "sentences", "is", "determined", "by", "the", "surrounding", "context", "and", "the", "meaning", "of", "the", "individual", "words", ",", "not", "the", "neutral", "target", "phrases", "themselves", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9752794504165649, 0.8808419704437256, 0.8653753995895386, 0.9998504519462585, 0.8594409823417664, 0.9995645880699158, 0.999998152256012, 0.9999133944511414, 0.9999743700027466, 0.9999046921730042, 0.9997186660766602, 0.9996635317802429, 0.999998152256012, 0.9991973638534546, 0.4444946348667145, 0.47514089941978455, 0.7096426486968994, 0.9213547110557556, 0.4236757457256317, 0.4507589340209961, 0.399059921503067, 0.9935489892959595, 0.5251988768577576, 0.4617784321308136, 0.6847522854804993, 0.997429609298706, 0.9999114274978638, 0.6535474061965942, 0.556958019733429, 0.9495763778686523, 0.3477880358695984, 0.5698787569999695, 0.402011901140213, 0.5414143800735474, 0.28261253237724304, 0.5731795430183411, 0.19863811135292053, 0.4001711905002594, 0.5354015827178955, 0.5776103734970093, 0.9929977059364319, 0.7056983709335327, 0.521168053150177, 0.4286210536956787, 0.8852412104606628, 0.3781721889972687, 0.5119501948356628, 0.4698482155799866, 0.9530648589134216, 0.8649998307228088, 0.3564700186252594, 0.646060049533844, 0.7842150330543518, 0.4022787809371948, 0.9971157312393188, 0.211556538939476, 0.27067801356315613, 0.815061092376709, 0.49908801913261414, 0.6269088983535767, 0.7342036366462708, 0.9116825461387634, 0.36744338274002075, 0.5071125030517578, 0.3857293426990509, 0.6701525449752808, 0.6763354539871216, 0.47808516025543213, 0.5395531058311462, 0.3899312913417816, 0.9961751699447632, 0.9971581697463989, 0.9999373555183411, 0.9972522854804993, 0.9998970031738281, 0.7509182691574097, 0.34138619899749756, 0.42842549085617065, 0.977017879486084, 0.9997662305831909, 0.9981980323791504, 0.741599440574646, 0.3029714822769165, 0.9428853392601013, 0.7382825613021851, 0.9919100999832153, 0.9999527335166931, 0.9998598694801331, 0.9996986389160156, 0.9974853992462158, 0.9999648928642273, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9998461008071899, 0.9646504521369934, 0.23934459686279297, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9989277720451355, 0.8409026265144348, 0.7765455842018127, 0.4052122235298157, 0.7650766372680664, 0.994220495223999, 0.9999762177467346, 0.9999540448188782, 0.9993756413459778, 0.9895534515380859, 0.9132854342460632, 0.9812429547309875, 0.9955429434776306, 0.9999886751174927, 0.9996973872184753, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9999799132347107, 0.9999472498893738, 0.9999921321868896, 0.9999131560325623, 0.9920201897621155, 0.9852869510650635, 0.999999463558197, 0.9998956322669983, 0.9991229176521301, 0.986589252948761, 0.9996197819709778, 0.45997077226638794, 0.9999964237213135, 0.8788604140281677, 0.6221230030059814, 0.9431771636009216, 0.9985353350639343, 0.6109414100646973, 0.3952474594116211, 0.5916897058486938, 0.9323736429214478, 0.9997816681861877, 0.8493406772613525, 0.49083614349365234, 0.5889727473258972, 0.40360552072525024, 0.6106864809989929, 0.18792089819908142, 0.9947267174720764, 0.8827328085899353, 0.5987263917922974, 0.9981624484062195, 0.49906471371650696, 0.8765900135040283, 0.6375137567520142, 0.9112130999565125, 0.4898560047149658, 0.7946901321411133, 0.9452189207077026, 0.9999881982803345, 0.9260143637657166], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.7096426486968994}
