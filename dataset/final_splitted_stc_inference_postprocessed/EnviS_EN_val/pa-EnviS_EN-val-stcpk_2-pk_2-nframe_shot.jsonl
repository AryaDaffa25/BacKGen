However, the sentiment subjectivity classification would be negative if the text suggested that regulation is an unnecessary burden or hindrance, as per the first sentiment stereotype provided in the background knowledge.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "is", "'", "neut", "ral", "'.", "While", "the", "word", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "itself", "is", "neutral", ",", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", "suggests", "that", "the", "regulation", "of", "agricultural", "chemicals", "is", "a", "necessary", "action", "to", "prevent", "harm", "to", "the", "environment", "and", "public", "health", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "in", "this", "context", "is", "neutral", "as", "it", "is", "a", "des", "irable", "action", "with", "positive", "implications", "for", "the", "environment", "and", "public", "health", ".", "However", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "classification", "would", "be", "negative", "if", "the", "text", "suggested", "that", "regulation", "is", "an", "unnecessary", "burden", "or", "hind", "r", "ance", ",", "as", "per", "the", "first", "sentiment", "stere", "otype", "provided", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8509953618049622, 0.7687525153160095, 0.9232088327407837, 0.862116813659668, 0.9999659061431885, 0.6339915990829468, 0.9646909236907959, 0.5146858096122742, 0.9997760653495789, 0.7140365242958069, 0.9995236396789551, 0.9999773502349854, 0.9984269142150879, 0.6182417273521423, 0.6934173107147217, 0.6779624223709106, 0.9999943971633911, 0.5148950815200806, 0.32714375853538513, 0.6106430888175964, 0.18863727152347565, 0.9581380486488342, 0.9999728202819824, 0.9994957447052002, 0.9998836517333984, 0.7125393748283386, 0.6232602596282959, 0.471163272857666, 0.9105236530303955, 0.8641524910926819, 0.42212480306625366, 0.5528953075408936, 0.9529855847358704, 0.6964067816734314, 0.32150354981422424, 0.6392890214920044, 0.7114440202713013, 0.739096999168396, 0.435525506734848, 0.9957633018493652, 0.9999762773513794, 0.6471220850944519, 0.6346683502197266, 0.6897428035736084, 0.4113754332065582, 0.7613021731376648, 0.4511811137199402, 0.9199132323265076, 0.9841089844703674, 0.996476948261261, 0.999922513961792, 0.7806522846221924, 0.3498292863368988, 0.9999468326568604, 0.49646323919296265, 0.7280399799346924, 0.9999003410339355, 0.9209375381469727, 0.835372269153595, 0.7739410996437073, 0.9999902248382568, 0.4955442547798157, 0.7990478277206421, 0.61951744556427, 0.9995294809341431, 0.9079321026802063, 0.9984122514724731, 0.9994332194328308, 0.9813970327377319, 0.5273449420928955, 0.9353653192520142, 0.8372566103935242, 0.6816226243972778, 0.5997620820999146, 0.49682289361953735, 0.715686023235321, 0.4440103769302368, 0.381071001291275, 0.26204249262809753, 0.9995667338371277, 0.7324913144111633, 0.27606940269470215, 0.7232035398483276, 0.2588125765323639, 0.5285978317260742, 0.8620593547821045, 0.9505590796470642, 0.9659192562103271, 0.9938136339187622, 0.9920738935470581, 0.8896064162254333, 0.43477752804756165, 0.9999897480010986, 0.5315936207771301, 0.575233519077301, 0.5718647837638855, 0.9999960660934448, 0.47215452790260315, 0.35779884457588196, 0.6802677512168884, 0.7620312571525574, 0.7640331387519836, 0.9774088859558105, 0.4614425301551819, 0.2579706013202667, 0.7074303030967712, 0.28751689195632935, 0.5017160177230835, 0.5484215617179871, 0.6873321533203125, 0.7772964239120483, 0.9120213985443115, 0.3695652484893799, 0.9874271154403687, 0.9993979930877686, 0.5187462568283081, 0.8423258066177368, 0.7991295456886292, 0.5335583090782166, 0.6080702543258667, 0.8231296539306641, 0.9890649318695068, 0.9999899864196777, 0.9155417084693909, 0.6750765442848206, 0.9998975992202759, 0.9998753070831299, 0.9999922513961792, 0.9999425411224365, 0.9198106527328491], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.6779624223709106}

However, the sentiment phrase 'needs to' itself is neutral and does not add to or detract from the positive sentiment expressed in the text.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "ne", "eds", "to", "'", "is", "'", "neut", "ral", "'.", "The", "phrase", "'", "ne", "eds", "to", "'", "is", "a", "modal", "verb", "that", "express", "es", "necessity", "or", "obligation", ",", "and", "it", "does", "not", "inher", "ently", "convey", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "classification", "depends", "on", "the", "context", "of", "the", "sentence", "and", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "s", "relationship", "to", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "expressed", "in", "the", "text", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "the", "text", "'", "s", "sentiment", "is", "positive", ",", "as", "it", "emphas", "izes", "the", "importance", "of", "addressing", "climate", "change", "and", "making", "it", "a", "campaign", "issue", ".", "However", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "ne", "eds", "to", "'", "itself", "is", "neutral", "and", "does", "not", "add", "to", "or", "det", "ract", "from", "the", "positive", "sentiment", "expressed", "in", "the", "text", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9042951464653015, 0.7084938287734985, 0.8424661159515381, 0.8095037341117859, 0.9999816417694092, 0.6769510507583618, 0.9182083010673523, 0.5986232757568359, 0.9931936860084534, 0.999721109867096, 0.7405223250389099, 0.9998329877853394, 0.9999997615814209, 0.9999934434890747, 0.9990634322166443, 0.9056845307350159, 0.3909541964530945, 0.6436527371406555, 0.9999904632568359, 0.5056651830673218, 0.45221665501594543, 0.4415079951286316, 0.5530236959457397, 0.9996304512023926, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9999265670776367, 0.9953823685646057, 0.38112324476242065, 0.2989480495452881, 0.2885972261428833, 0.9554804563522339, 0.3611029386520386, 0.24336379766464233, 0.9998270869255066, 0.478098064661026, 0.5509960651397705, 0.8191824555397034, 0.5682750940322876, 0.5382055044174194, 0.7731353044509888, 0.73375403881073, 0.9999262094497681, 0.3011520802974701, 0.9999794960021973, 0.5112532377243042, 0.7510573863983154, 0.9998676776885986, 0.9999798536300659, 0.6160418391227722, 0.9034724235534668, 0.4857119619846344, 0.4432940185070038, 0.46278905868530273, 0.9997902512550354, 0.39603349566459656, 0.6242914795875549, 0.9872654676437378, 0.9992809891700745, 0.8697943687438965, 0.32470402121543884, 0.9963674545288086, 0.24446813762187958, 0.5430448055267334, 0.9824503660202026, 0.864984929561615, 0.8340568542480469, 0.516508936882019, 0.9999468326568604, 0.5815919041633606, 0.9092646837234497, 0.6248149871826172, 0.3797932267189026, 0.6750759482383728, 0.62550950050354, 0.8508154153823853, 0.9998571872711182, 0.9949616193771362, 0.9523398280143738, 0.7723879814147949, 0.8547472953796387, 0.7628084421157837, 0.999993085861206, 0.8771010041236877, 0.42896556854248047, 0.2724708914756775, 0.9999880790710449, 0.917413592338562, 0.9328869581222534, 0.38497695326805115, 0.485186904668808, 0.6432753205299377, 0.8951122760772705, 0.36138060688972473, 0.9999340772628784, 0.9786060452461243, 0.8462847471237183, 0.8975122570991516, 0.40388965606689453, 0.9888181090354919, 0.9999749660491943, 0.4592269957065582, 0.9837729334831238, 0.9997714161872864, 0.9932810664176941, 0.4843117892742157, 0.9996009469032288, 0.9189059734344482, 0.825510561466217, 0.9999957084655762, 0.9592072367668152, 0.7042544484138489, 0.976244330406189, 0.8105717897415161, 0.9999409914016724, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9999048709869385, 0.9985744953155518, 0.7926575541496277, 0.7057258486747742, 0.9310891032218933, 0.32083484530448914, 0.9556019306182861, 0.999970555305481, 0.3578419089317322, 0.731097936630249, 0.583764910697937, 0.9647988677024841, 0.9999679327011108, 0.9998822212219238, 0.9917442202568054, 0.7298098802566528, 0.9987414479255676, 0.49364081025123596, 0.9944739937782288, 0.9999890327453613, 0.9836490154266357, 0.9914650321006775, 0.6145287156105042], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.6436527371406555}

However, the sentiment phrase 'strangest' itself is not the source of the negative sentiment and therefore does not fit neatly into the positive or negative sentiment subjectivity stereotypes provided in the background knowledge.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "str", "ang", "est", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "str", "ang", "est", "'", "itself", "does", "not", "convey", "a", "positive", "or", "negative", "emotion", ",", "but", "rather", "describes", "the", "unusual", "nature", "of", "the", "customer", "service", "policy", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "classification", "depends", "on", "the", "sentiment", "of", "the", "overall", "text", ",", "which", "in", "this", "case", "is", "negative", "due", "to", "the", "customer", "'", "s", "frustration", "with", "the", "policy", ".", "However", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "str", "ang", "est", "'", "itself", "is", "not", "the", "source", "of", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "and", "therefore", "does", "not", "fit", "neat", "ly", "into", "the", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "stere", "ot", "ypes", "provided", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7571350336074829, 0.6850573420524597, 0.9681863784790039, 0.7910996079444885, 0.9999793767929077, 0.5204594731330872, 0.9530900716781616, 0.48167547583580017, 0.9994851350784302, 0.5486894845962524, 0.9999090433120728, 0.9998396635055542, 1.0, 0.9995552897453308, 0.8966489434242249, 0.4866147041320801, 0.4806876480579376, 0.5536478161811829, 0.34653258323669434, 0.9628273248672485, 0.35117146372795105, 0.9998873472213745, 0.9999188184738159, 1.0, 0.9991770386695862, 0.6164351105690002, 0.46792668104171753, 0.9987778067588806, 0.300435870885849, 0.5123058557510376, 0.7466548085212708, 0.9860610961914062, 0.9962215423583984, 0.6130810976028442, 0.33248642086982727, 0.573003351688385, 0.8352417945861816, 0.4813116192817688, 0.37995150685310364, 0.3531380593776703, 0.657889187335968, 0.9984427094459534, 0.9617428779602051, 0.8182013034820557, 0.9998099207878113, 0.9998972415924072, 0.6066887974739075, 0.5162559747695923, 0.37104344367980957, 0.7651609182357788, 0.9990817308425903, 0.38953956961631775, 0.20077592134475708, 0.90340256690979, 0.99454665184021, 0.44967973232269287, 0.5443997383117676, 0.9991094470024109, 0.3085799515247345, 0.8070356845855713, 0.6283941268920898, 0.7481256723403931, 0.5932495594024658, 0.9974105954170227, 0.9966694712638855, 0.5828582644462585, 0.8357083201408386, 0.833099901676178, 0.9996033310890198, 0.9948409199714661, 0.12483833730220795, 0.7040486931800842, 0.9999872446060181, 0.9230272173881531, 0.9786721467971802, 0.986753523349762, 0.7967990636825562, 0.849217414855957, 0.9396547675132751, 0.9999905824661255, 0.9874123334884644, 0.9778389930725098, 0.992258608341217, 0.9184098839759827, 0.9999945163726807, 0.9999765157699585, 1.0, 0.9975025057792664, 0.4790046215057373, 0.49988412857055664, 0.4463637173175812, 0.40289273858070374, 0.4728342592716217, 0.9999948740005493, 0.687783420085907, 0.7960124611854553, 0.8762351870536804, 0.3627629578113556, 0.3164648115634918, 0.29452016949653625, 0.9999847412109375, 0.3964913487434387, 0.9087308645248413, 0.9999995231628418, 0.999173104763031, 0.604574978351593, 0.6370740532875061, 0.9899360537528992, 0.9999822378158569, 0.9634819030761719, 0.9804872870445251, 0.9999587535858154, 0.6562435626983643, 0.9585736989974976, 0.999782383441925, 0.8246012926101685, 0.5152156352996826, 0.9993758797645569, 0.998796820640564, 0.99998939037323, 0.9893025755882263, 0.6783215403556824], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.4866147041320801}

Therefore, while the sentiment phrase itself is neutral, the overall sentiment towards the topic of 'food safety' in the text is likely to be negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "of", "too", "much", "'", "is", "'", "neut", "ral", "'", "because", "it", "does", "not", "express", "a", "clear", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "amount", "or", "excess", "iveness", "of", "food", "safety", ".", "The", "phrase", "'", "too", "much", "'", "can", "be", "interpreted", "as", "an", "objective", "description", "rather", "than", "a", "sentiment", "expression", ".", "However", ",", "based", "on", "the", "context", "provided", ",", "it", "is", "more", "likely", "that", "the", "sentiment", "towards", "'", "too", "much", "food", "safety", "'", "is", "negative", "due", "to", "the", "potential", "risks", "and", "costs", "associated", "with", "excessive", "regulations", "and", "ins", "pe", "ctions", ".", "Therefore", ",", "while", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "itself", "is", "neutral", ",", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "topic", "of", "'", "food", "safety", "'", "in", "the", "text", "is", "likely", "to", "be", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7931506037712097, 0.6204968094825745, 0.9014878869056702, 0.6724381446838379, 0.9999680519104004, 0.5468196272850037, 0.4906349778175354, 0.5416923761367798, 0.99931800365448, 0.6037865281105042, 0.9994897842407227, 0.9999946355819702, 0.9999974966049194, 0.9993995428085327, 0.8401183485984802, 0.3634647727012634, 0.6488303542137146, 0.9999833106994629, 0.4851217567920685, 0.5254165530204773, 0.6080904006958008, 0.6495038270950317, 0.9994695782661438, 0.2817198634147644, 0.4659912884235382, 0.6344760060310364, 0.9610739350318909, 0.9987998008728027, 0.9999594688415527, 0.5229885578155518, 0.9031936526298523, 0.8665124177932739, 0.12635007500648499, 0.5227456092834473, 0.24941866099834442, 0.9049856662750244, 0.6444036960601807, 0.36976906657218933, 0.9999769926071167, 0.2828163802623749, 0.45756617188453674, 0.2576140761375427, 0.61676424741745, 0.5699528455734253, 0.9999953508377075, 0.6825978755950928, 0.45193207263946533, 0.6806490421295166, 0.6649377346038818, 0.6710174679756165, 0.36249685287475586, 0.5179335474967957, 0.37287193536758423, 0.49454039335250854, 0.9999861717224121, 0.6339757442474365, 0.4390304386615753, 0.4535253942012787, 0.7440794110298157, 0.4094420373439789, 0.9999873638153076, 0.3546910881996155, 0.9994970560073853, 0.9864962697029114, 0.43764203786849976, 0.39282456040382385, 0.464862585067749, 0.5490571856498718, 0.6238963603973389, 0.4542095959186554, 0.8994556069374084, 0.4597906768321991, 0.6813316345214844, 0.6381009817123413, 0.6100759506225586, 0.5554117560386658, 0.5958977341651917, 0.9999951124191284, 0.9318602681159973, 0.9999853372573853, 0.9997318387031555, 0.6753979921340942, 0.973944902420044, 0.3296457529067993, 0.9997715353965759, 0.7684257626533508, 0.6251280307769775, 0.7921295762062073, 0.7066917419433594, 0.49158141016960144, 0.9478681087493896, 0.9985263347625732, 0.8367774486541748, 0.6978782415390015, 0.8721866011619568, 0.8167911767959595, 0.9999990463256836, 1.0, 0.7974873185157776, 0.4180183708667755, 0.9999929666519165, 0.3508223295211792, 0.9774686098098755, 0.99162358045578, 0.9686782956123352, 0.9594928622245789, 0.9914602041244507, 0.95869380235672, 0.9992247819900513, 0.9512559771537781, 0.47222650051116943, 0.9623278379440308, 0.8464564681053162, 0.4889131188392639, 0.5905499458312988, 0.7388342618942261, 0.7598861455917358, 0.5704116225242615, 0.9999940395355225, 0.9995850920677185, 0.410259485244751, 0.5005805492401123, 0.9161310195922852, 0.7249936461448669, 0.7810095548629761, 0.6943005323410034, 0.9999474287033081, 0.9986553192138672, 0.4804368019104004, 0.8775920271873474], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.6488303542137146}

Therefore, the negative sentiment subjectivity is a reasonable classification for this sentiment phrase.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "at", "the", "expense", "'", "is", "'", "negative", "'.", "This", "is", "because", "the", "phrase", "'", "at", "the", "expense", "'", "implies", "that", "one", "thing", "is", "being", "sacrific", "ed", "or", "given", "up", "in", "order", "to", "achieve", "another", ",", "which", "can", "be", "perceived", "as", "a", "loss", "or", "negative", "consequence", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "phrase", "suggests", "that", "the", "'", "rap", "id", "progress", "'", "towards", "low", "carbon", "transitions", "may", "come", "at", "the", "cost", "of", "something", "else", ",", "such", "as", "social", "justice", ",", "which", "is", "generally", "considered", "a", "des", "irable", "aspect", "of", "society", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "is", "a", "reasonable", "classification", "for", "this", "sentiment", "phrase", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8160194158554077, 0.6715359091758728, 0.9517716765403748, 0.6296201944351196, 0.9999752044677734, 0.5636833310127258, 0.9372645616531372, 0.4619935154914856, 0.9918334484100342, 0.9996718168258667, 0.6588180065155029, 0.9999077320098877, 0.9999992847442627, 0.9999006986618042, 0.9970496892929077, 0.9858908653259277, 0.5002574324607849, 0.9324860572814941, 0.596628725528717, 0.6462203860282898, 0.7943617701530457, 0.9635926485061646, 0.7985564470291138, 0.8809017539024353, 0.3892216980457306, 0.9999667406082153, 0.9999988079071045, 0.9999891519546509, 0.9440674781799316, 0.37164148688316345, 0.6099894642829895, 0.4466591477394104, 0.9779815077781677, 0.8494632840156555, 0.9668753743171692, 0.7625727653503418, 0.9999982118606567, 0.8064903020858765, 0.5299862623214722, 0.9998496770858765, 0.6595170497894287, 0.9974576830863953, 0.9873600602149963, 0.9326086640357971, 0.8294491171836853, 0.8801074624061584, 0.5420819520950317, 0.4586203992366791, 0.6992625594139099, 0.3770192265510559, 0.9667577147483826, 0.9845424890518188, 0.803920328617096, 0.9901767373085022, 0.4838078022003174, 0.8073890209197998, 0.8016358017921448, 0.7216044068336487, 0.6541496515274048, 0.925216019153595, 0.9988470077514648, 0.914330780506134, 0.4593646228313446, 0.5623785257339478, 0.9972934126853943, 0.634661853313446, 0.7569464445114136, 0.9988288283348083, 1.0, 0.9999910593032837, 0.9988448619842529, 0.43322494626045227, 0.34732145071029663, 0.9111382961273193, 0.9825810790061951, 0.6938418745994568, 0.8100537657737732, 0.9784557223320007, 0.9721153378486633, 0.8488467335700989, 0.9080767035484314, 0.4178653359413147, 0.7503654360771179, 0.9695000648498535, 0.6059429049491882, 0.9999532699584961, 0.998859167098999, 0.9999644756317139, 0.6764782667160034, 0.7888706922531128, 0.9100711345672607, 0.41859525442123413, 0.8471243381500244, 0.917666494846344, 0.5780937075614929, 0.9999842643737793, 0.5874651670455933, 0.9972875118255615, 0.8555185198783875, 0.8318368196487427, 0.592736542224884, 0.9992319345474243, 0.9021288156509399, 0.47592130303382874, 0.9435496926307678, 0.9498597979545593, 0.9999884366989136, 0.3899604380130768, 0.2755354642868042, 0.5161026120185852, 0.9464432001113892, 0.40052229166030884, 0.6829322576522827, 0.7731990814208984, 0.9998443126678467, 0.7424106001853943, 0.8272630572319031], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.9324860572814941}

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity for the sentiment phrase 'compliant' in this context is 'positive' because it is a necessary step towards achieving the positive goal stated in the text. However, the 'neutral' classification is not incorrect because the term 'compliant' itself is neutral, but the sentiment subjectivity should be determined based on the overall context of the text.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "com", "pl", "iant", "'", "is", "'", "neut", "ral", "'", "because",
