This background knowledge can be used to further emphasize the negative sentiment towards the subject matter, as the speaker's shock at the condition of the public restrooms may be a reflection of their disappointment and frustration with the lack of investment in public infrastructure.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["Neg", "ative", "\n", "Reason", ":", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "sh", "ocked", "\"", "is", "typically", "associated", "with", "negative", "emotions", "such", "as", "surprise", ",", "disappointment", ",", "or", "dis", "bel", "ief", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "speaker", "express", "es", "shock", "at", "the", "dirty", "and", "rund", "own", "condition", "of", "public", "rest", "rooms", "in", "N", "W", "I", "A", ",", "imp", "lying", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "subject", "matter", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "provided", "does", "not", "seem", "to", "be", "directly", "related", "to", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", ",", "but", "it", "does", "highlight", "the", "importance", "of", "caring", "for", "valuable", "local", "es", "and", "the", "frustration", "that", "ar", "ises", "when", "leaders", "fail", "to", "prior", "itize", "public", "improvements", ".", "This", "background", "knowledge", "can", "be", "used", "to", "further", "emphas", "ize", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "subject", "matter", ",", "as", "the", "speaker", "'", "s", "shock", "at", "the", "condition", "of", "the", "public", "rest", "rooms", "may", "be", "a", "reflection", "of", "their", "disappointment", "and", "frustration", "with", "the", "lack", "of", "investment", "in", "public", "infrastructure", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.37144148349761963, 0.9999962449073792, 0.38083186745643616, 0.7874727845191956, 0.66765958070755, 0.9594022035598755, 0.9632999300956726, 0.4762360155582428, 0.6578032374382019, 0.9998188614845276, 0.9999229311943054, 0.9978722929954529, 0.3847600221633911, 0.3029946982860565, 0.8835921287536621, 0.9999495148658752, 0.5124163627624512, 0.5931216478347778, 0.51913982629776, 0.9992691278457642, 0.555989682674408, 0.9050752520561218, 0.4767703115940094, 0.9612926840782166, 0.5570635199546814, 0.41977691650390625, 0.8473600745201111, 0.9999974966049194, 0.5747944116592407, 0.6120801568031311, 0.8251333832740784, 0.8879815936088562, 0.9978410601615906, 0.7369208335876465, 0.3790244162082672, 0.33696359395980835, 0.9584832191467285, 0.2899380922317505, 0.8458667397499084, 0.9891639351844788, 0.382353276014328, 0.9988532066345215, 0.988303542137146, 0.9999999403953552, 0.8490777015686035, 0.9999926686286926, 0.4988272190093994, 0.9999518394470215, 0.9999226927757263, 0.5667321681976318, 0.9741114377975464, 0.9999812841415405, 0.8961209654808044, 0.9997825026512146, 0.7769456505775452, 0.39762890338897705, 0.999998152256012, 0.6602773070335388, 0.826594352722168, 0.448562890291214, 0.9854060411453247, 0.7795864343643188, 0.46398377418518066, 0.37996429204940796, 0.9282907843589783, 0.6835036873817444, 0.7939185500144958, 0.9955621361732483, 0.5320502519607544, 0.6013842225074768, 0.9981986880302429, 0.19726715981960297, 0.8895670175552368, 0.3327071964740753, 0.8129456043243408, 0.9451183080673218, 0.9986847043037415, 0.717411994934082, 0.8721649646759033, 0.6579232215881348, 0.40759211778640747, 0.746457576751709, 0.745989978313446, 0.4268510341644287, 0.38978275656700134, 0.8447495102882385, 0.8943641185760498, 0.9994087219238281, 0.3954070210456848, 0.9999651312828064, 0.4825004041194916, 0.9983969926834106, 0.9999964237213135, 0.7737203240394592, 0.562168300151825, 0.5869589447975159, 0.7944968938827515, 0.4176620841026306, 0.9999717473983765, 0.8920945525169373, 0.5648162961006165, 0.793165922164917, 0.9999925494194031, 0.9822792410850525, 0.9999768733978271, 0.6773552894592285, 0.9998666048049927, 0.9506850838661194, 0.3449122905731201, 0.29947641491889954, 0.9951698184013367, 0.24577951431274414, 0.3960586190223694, 0.889140248298645, 0.9805817008018494, 0.2867317199707031, 0.4123782217502594, 0.9999960064888, 0.9998360276222229, 0.9720771908760071, 0.9692850708961487, 0.41202181577682495, 0.9948633313179016, 0.2566602826118469, 0.8712015748023987, 0.4081164002418518, 0.8977277874946594, 0.8132937550544739, 0.43672630190849304, 0.9591931700706482, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9540744423866272, 0.26517748832702637, 0.9999656081199646, 0.38800114393234253, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9965305924415588, 0.8714061975479126, 0.99977707862854, 0.9996997714042664, 0.25914180278778076, 0.8546978831291199, 0.6662550568580627, 0.6155980825424194, 0.9999996423721313, 0.7602560520172119, 0.8101006150245667, 0.530803918838501, 0.9935144186019897, 0.9879607558250427, 0.9850172400474548, 0.9729234576225281, 0.9999957084655762, 0.7480959296226501, 0.801498532295227, 0.9946044683456421, 0.5715380907058716, 0.6544522047042847, 0.9174306988716125], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.37144148349761963}
