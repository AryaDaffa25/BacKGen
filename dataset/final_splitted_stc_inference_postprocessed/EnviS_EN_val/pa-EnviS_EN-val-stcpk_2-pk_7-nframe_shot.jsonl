Therefore, the negative sentiment subjectivity of the phrase \"increase in cost is often seen as a roadblock\" is a reasonable classification result.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "in", "cre", "ase", "in", "cost", "is", "often", "seen", "as", "a", "road", "block", "\"", "is", "negative", ".", "This", "is", "because", "the", "phrase", "\"", "in", "cre", "ase", "in", "cost", "\"", "is", "often", "associated", "with", "negative", "sentiment", ",", "as", "it", "is", "commonly", "perceived", "as", "a", "hind", "r", "ance", "or", "obst", "acle", "to", "achieving", "a", "goal", ",", "particularly", "when", "it", "comes", "to", "sustainable", "product", "design", "or", "environmental", "initiatives", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "provided", "also", "rein", "for", "ces", "this", "sentiment", ",", "as", "it", "highlights", "the", "negative", "impact", "of", "costs", "on", "individuals", "and", "the", "environment", ",", "and", "the", "frustration", "and", "concern", "that", "can", "arise", "from", "the", "constant", "presence", "of", "expenses", "and", "financial", "bur", "d", "ens", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "phrase", "\"", "in", "cre", "ase", "in", "cost", "is", "often", "seen", "as", "a", "road", "block", "\"", "is", "a", "reasonable", "classification", "result", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9095171689987183, 0.6529804468154907, 0.9692585468292236, 0.7610760927200317, 0.9999944567680359, 0.805137574672699, 0.9856720566749573, 0.7752888202667236, 0.9962844252586365, 0.9999112486839294, 0.5396793484687805, 0.9554771780967712, 0.9999943971633911, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999938607215881, 0.9999903440475464, 0.9999926686286926, 0.9999601244926453, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9999879002571106, 0.9999904632568359, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9997422695159912, 0.9930619597434998, 0.6465374231338501, 0.6156225204467773, 0.4915609359741211, 0.8223977088928223, 0.9384992122650146, 0.6715468168258667, 0.41172781586647034, 0.44020646810531616, 0.824766218662262, 0.9999973773956299, 0.9999961853027344, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999948740005493, 0.9850368499755859, 0.89458829164505, 0.38523560762405396, 0.9668132066726685, 0.9997188448905945, 0.8006090521812439, 0.23750150203704834, 0.35982638597488403, 0.44061076641082764, 0.5714267492294312, 0.4169600009918213, 0.6266628503799438, 0.7032299041748047, 0.9648666977882385, 0.5797386169433594, 0.5979767441749573, 0.9999982118606567, 0.9999973177909851, 0.7720448970794678, 0.3670424222946167, 0.9996541738510132, 0.6670694947242737, 0.647896945476532, 0.9422089457511902, 0.6846823692321777, 0.5589021444320679, 0.5963951349258423, 0.5709606409072876, 0.8656965494155884, 0.9974014163017273, 0.9999983906745911, 0.4255962669849396, 0.969942033290863, 0.9996804594993591, 0.379191130399704, 0.25539129972457886, 0.674462616443634, 0.7673209309577942, 0.646561324596405, 0.43946003913879395, 0.9994407892227173, 0.49300718307495117, 0.30040159821510315, 0.3851619064807892, 0.9999960064888, 1.0, 0.8138794302940369, 0.3184058368206024, 0.7640414237976074, 0.7609705924987793, 0.9657427072525024, 0.5954537391662598, 0.9483197927474976, 0.8265039920806885, 0.7594957947731018, 0.8099206686019897, 0.3624706268310547, 0.582324206829071, 0.3005422353744507, 0.634319543838501, 0.9658026695251465, 0.9566226601600647, 0.649930477142334, 0.5281597375869751, 0.9507006406784058, 0.5225282907485962, 0.7508141994476318, 0.9220422506332397, 0.7205958366394043, 0.39811015129089355, 0.5397226214408875, 0.5739588737487793, 0.4674430191516876, 0.33564868569374084, 0.8429460525512695, 0.9532843232154846, 0.36375656723976135, 0.704748809337616, 0.4204423725605011, 0.9970026612281799, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9999960064888, 0.9980186223983765, 0.3639583885669708, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9487763047218323, 0.5113258957862854, 0.9937731623649597, 0.9197901487350464, 0.999998152256012, 0.5161490440368652, 0.9609525799751282, 0.4851538836956024, 0.6386403441429138, 0.9999264478683472, 0.9999877214431763, 0.9999983310699463, 1.0, 0.9999978542327881, 0.8389072418212891, 0.9997818470001221, 0.9999437928199768, 0.9999926686286926, 0.999947726726532, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9999886751174927, 0.9730037450790405, 0.6079739928245544, 0.7680318355560303, 0.5792661905288696, 0.4806615114212036, 0.6209511160850525, 0.9736320972442627], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.6465374231338501}

However, the sentiment phrase 'visa' does not directly relate to these issues and therefore does not carry any sentiment subjectivity on its own.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "vis", "a", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "itself", "does", "not", "carry", "any", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", ",", "as", "it", "is", "a", "neutral", "term", "that", "refers", "to", "a", "document", "issued", "by", "a", "government", "that", "allows", "a", "person", "to", "enter", ",", "leave", ",", "or", "stay", "in", "a", "country", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "text", "as", "a", "whole", "is", "negative", ",", "as", "it", "express", "es", "frustration", "and", "disappointment", "with", "various", "issues", ",", "including", "government", "in", "eff", "ici", "encies", ",", "high", "costs", ",", "and", "quar", "antine", "requirements", ".", "However", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "vis", "a", "'", "does", "not", "directly", "relate", "to", "these", "issues", "and", "therefore", "does", "not", "carry", "any", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "on", "its", "own", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8504785895347595, 0.6916557550430298, 0.9871873259544373, 0.9153889417648315, 0.9999929666519165, 0.8236697316169739, 0.9927346706390381, 0.6439815163612366, 0.9998501539230347, 0.7036435604095459, 0.99957275390625, 0.9999952912330627, 0.9990749955177307, 0.6513658761978149, 0.465472549200058, 0.49307164549827576, 0.6520035266876221, 0.41123586893081665, 0.9854487180709839, 0.6282426118850708, 0.8033052682876587, 0.9999251365661621, 0.24637287855148315, 0.7592829465866089, 0.45192810893058777, 0.9997292757034302, 0.9999234676361084, 0.44429171085357666, 0.391755074262619, 0.5587671995162964, 0.9546774625778198, 0.692739725112915, 0.47142213582992554, 0.3322412371635437, 0.9058601260185242, 0.4073547422885895, 0.5731505155563354, 0.9976381659507751, 0.8993807435035706, 0.8360667824745178, 0.2531241178512573, 0.9803900718688965, 0.8667623996734619, 0.8894347548484802, 0.2382071316242218, 0.575860857963562, 0.6241731643676758, 0.6725914478302002, 0.9992825984954834, 0.7964243292808533, 0.5991930961608887, 0.9460927844047546, 0.931248664855957, 0.9984127283096313, 0.44424715638160706, 0.9873090982437134, 0.9572122693061829, 0.9448425769805908, 0.682453453540802, 0.9040263295173645, 0.4361339807510376, 0.32471248507499695, 0.9999561905860901, 0.47104543447494507, 0.9676154255867004, 0.5993761420249939, 0.8927367925643921, 0.9999768733978271, 0.9999999403953552, 0.6506036520004272, 0.9651522636413574, 0.5279133319854736, 0.4336346685886383, 0.964971125125885, 0.5215070247650146, 0.9999874830245972, 0.6749798655509949, 0.9109777808189392, 0.6036203503608704, 0.48558759689331055, 0.9254039525985718, 0.6434524059295654, 0.5208920240402222, 0.6973416805267334, 0.7708061337471008, 0.8758426904678345, 0.9511205554008484, 0.9051465392112732, 0.9995042681694031, 0.8357572555541992, 0.36602649092674255, 0.5613585710525513, 0.9353247880935669, 0.9908556342124939, 0.9035868644714355, 0.8846644163131714, 0.6217947006225586, 0.6419973373413086, 0.9558990597724915, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9896658062934875, 0.995868444442749, 0.9922029972076416, 0.9919086694717407, 0.9999707341194153, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9993911385536194, 0.45157361030578613, 0.9999948740005493, 0.45137813687324524, 0.9510271549224854, 0.9999960064888, 0.7601889371871948, 0.7586013674736023, 0.7009634375572205, 0.26695501804351807, 0.7607089877128601, 0.999991774559021, 0.9081037640571594, 0.7903242707252502, 0.4468366205692291, 0.8371907472610474, 0.9992469549179077, 0.4188019931316376, 0.9999977350234985, 0.999995768070221, 0.9996145367622375, 0.9176633358001709], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.465472549200058}

This hinders the progress towards taking effective action to reduce our carbon footprint and adopt more sustainable practices, making it a negative sentiment subjectivity.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "so", "called", "climate", "change", "'", "is", "'", "negative", "'.", "The", "reason", "is", "that", "the", "phrase", "is", "often", "used", "to", "dismiss", "or", "down", "play", "the", "scientific", "consensus", "on", "climate", "change", ",", "which", "is", "a", "major", "issue", "causing", "immense", "damage", "and", "neg", "atively", "impact", "ing", "our", "lives", ".", "The", "use", "of", "the", "term", "'", "so", "called", "'", "implies", "a", "lack", "of", "belief", "or", "recognition", "of", "the", "valid", "ity", "of", "the", "concept", ",", "which", "is", "a", "common", "tact", "ic", "used", "to", "spread", "false", "information", "and", "mis", "con", "ceptions", "about", "climate", "change", ".", "This", "hind", "ers", "the", "progress", "towards", "taking", "effective", "action", "to", "reduce", "our", "carbon", "foot", "print", "and", "adopt", "more", "sustainable", "practices", ",", "making", "it", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.6298946738243103, 0.6272587180137634, 0.9669023156166077, 0.7815308570861816, 0.9999879002571106, 0.6562583446502686, 0.9344189763069153, 0.5227552652359009, 0.9978169798851013, 0.99989914894104, 0.7657579779624939, 0.9992769956588745, 0.9998170137405396, 0.9999955296516418, 0.9999905228614807, 0.9996973872184753, 0.9866502285003662, 0.5430974364280701, 0.9290828108787537, 0.6150285005569458, 0.5707369446754456, 0.4193677306175232, 0.6459223031997681, 0.9478250741958618, 0.947091817855835, 0.575411856174469, 0.3715001344680786, 0.47421494126319885, 0.9904237985610962, 0.5232096314430237, 0.5188251733779907, 0.6231576204299927, 0.26333802938461304, 0.9999604225158691, 0.9999546408653259, 0.2844636142253876, 0.6106624603271484, 0.5224851965904236, 0.6258085370063782, 0.9999892115592957, 0.5650373101234436, 0.28568679094314575, 0.5796533823013306, 0.9094727635383606, 0.4074981212615967, 0.6162453293800354, 0.37838053703308105, 0.6240042448043823, 0.9922032952308655, 0.5020259618759155, 0.9925307035446167, 0.999984860420227, 0.9990684390068054, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9864106178283691, 0.9998838305473328, 0.8238701224327087, 0.5588758587837219, 0.3448267877101898, 0.9999952912330627, 0.9265022873878479, 0.5910655856132507, 0.9992881417274475, 0.999961256980896, 0.9983668923377991, 0.9985223412513733, 0.8235467672348022, 0.7907429933547974, 0.8197807669639587, 0.9999983310699463, 0.6191486716270447, 0.9316542148590088, 0.4348151385784149, 0.6145763993263245, 0.9877890348434448, 0.39154675602912903, 0.9998279809951782, 0.839192271232605, 0.8552462458610535, 0.48006874322891235, 0.7349111437797546, 0.4726535677909851, 0.703056275844574, 0.8100308179855347, 0.6817169785499573, 0.8931935429573059, 0.9999964237213135, 0.9855664968490601, 0.8375458121299744, 0.8852087259292603, 0.6211764216423035, 0.9880143404006958, 0.9663279056549072, 0.8764910697937012, 0.9955419898033142, 0.9999144077301025, 0.5088633894920349, 0.8481398820877075, 0.9999539852142334, 0.8767116665840149, 0.37312644720077515, 0.2873746454715729, 0.995421290397644, 0.4986881911754608, 0.7740201354026794, 0.9456164836883545, 0.4432387351989746, 0.9928063154220581, 0.9877349138259888, 0.8802006840705872, 0.44607776403427124, 0.8591497540473938, 0.9999591112136841, 0.9999878406524658, 0.9999944567680359, 0.9984287619590759, 0.9833561778068542, 0.9976814389228821, 0.9999991655349731, 0.999998152256012, 0.5608692765235901, 0.39861705899238586, 0.5144179463386536, 0.9971910119056702, 0.9570050239562988, 0.9835068583488464, 0.8828748464584351, 0.9979195594787598, 0.9740556478500366, 0.8172298073768616], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.9290828108787537}

From investing in soil health to reducing waste, and from promoting efficient use of resources to focusing on renewable energy, there are numerous initiatives that are making a positive impact. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security.

For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security.

From investing in soil health to reducing waste, and from promoting efficient use of resources to focusing on renewable energy, there are numerous initiatives that are making a positive impact. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations.

The insignificant actions taken by individuals and governments in response to the crisis, such as placing plastic cones or paying climate taxes, only serve to distract from the real issue. Meanwhile, the corrosion and rupture of undersea pipelines and the ubiquitous use of harmful substances in food products continue to contribute to the destruction of our environment and health. It is disheartening to see how far we are from taking meaningful action to address these issues and prevent further damage.", "In today's world, where various changes are taking place, it's heartening to see individuals and organizations taking steps towards a more sustainable future. From investing in soil health to reducing waste, and from promoting efficient use of resources to focusing on renewable energy, there are numerous initiatives that are making a positive impact. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations.

From investing in soil health to reducing waste, and from promoting efficient use of resources to focusing on renewable energy, there are numerous initiatives that are making a positive impact. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security. Moreover, focusing on reusables and recycling, instead of just paying to dump rubbish, is a more sustainable and necessary approach to waste management. It's encouraging to see that individuals and organizations are recognizing the importance of these steps and taking action", "The human stories at the heart of environmental conflicts are located in various places, from the United Kingdom to real estate events and even our own backyards.

For instance, India's commitment to reducing its emission intensity by 24% in 11 years is a significant achievement, and the invention of the world's first dual waste collection truck is a step in the right direction towards minimizing plastic waste. Additionally, the transformation of companies from producing biofuels to making nutraceuticals and other high-value products demonstrates the potential for innovation and adaptation in response to changing needs and priorities.

In this case, the text as a whole expresses a positive sentiment towards the continued installation of renewable energy sources, despite their capacity factors, as long as they are cost-effective compared to traditional energy sources.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "so", "what", "'", "is", "'", "neut", "ral", "'.", "The", "phrase", "does", "not", "express", "any", "positive", "or", "negative", "emotion", "towards", "the", "topic", "of", "the", "text", ",", "which", "is", "the", "continued", "installation", "of", "wind", "and", "solar", "energy", "despite", "their", "low", "capacity", "factors", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "is", "a", "dismiss", "ive", "and", "ind", "ifferent", "response", ",", "indicating", "a", "lack", "of", "emotional", "investment", "or", "engagement", "with", "the", "topic", ".", "It", "is", "important", "to", "note", "that", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "a", "phrase", "does", "not", "necessarily", "reflect", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", ",", "but", "rather", "the", "emotional", "tone", "convey", "ed", "by", "the", "specific", "phrase", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "the", "text", "as", "a", "whole", "express", "es", "a", "positive", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "continued", "installation", "of", "renew", "able", "energy", "sources", ",", "despite", "their", "capacity", "factors", ",", "as", "long", "as", "they", "are", "cost", "-", "effective", "compared", "to", "traditional", "energy", "sources", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.549221396446228, 0.8686354160308838, 0.9718793630599976, 0.5779467821121216, 0.9999901056289673, 0.6867699027061462, 0.9458742737770081, 0.529438316822052, 0.9998297691345215, 0.6423162817955017, 0.9974902868270874, 0.9999960064888, 0.9996819496154785, 0.474193274974823, 0.6562240123748779, 0.9949847459793091, 0.9999873638153076, 0.5726644992828369, 0.5862175822257996, 0.4157967269420624, 0.32323354482650757, 0.9998912811279297, 0.5492859482765198, 0.7811727523803711, 0.6689633131027222, 0.999276340007782, 0.9999021291732788, 0.47049808502197266, 0.5478367805480957, 0.9983107447624207, 0.2998645305633545, 0.384733110666275, 0.4782574772834778, 0.9618644118309021, 0.741327702999115, 0.5377765893936157, 0.8917553424835205, 0.728630542755127, 0.3579608201980591, 0.987109363079071, 0.9711709022521973, 0.801719605922699, 0.9999849200248718, 0.9999991655349731, 0.8631803393363953, 0.973972737789154, 0.7365103363990784, 0.9416258931159973, 0.9995822906494141, 0.9987848997116089, 0.6739879846572876, 0.47188273072242737, 0.48206138610839844, 0.8945633172988892, 0.5078495144844055, 0.30073636770248413, 0.2165670394897461, 0.9997208714485168, 0.3345443606376648, 0.6888859272003174, 0.9992804527282715, 0.6687286496162415, 0.6428654789924622, 0.29166170954704285, 0.7705457806587219, 0.9987013339996338, 0.9999287724494934, 0.27041617035865784, 0.5375900268554688, 0.5247386693954468, 0.38651394844055176, 0.8996412754058838, 0.999969482421875, 0.8939921259880066, 0.8665209412574768, 0.3007969558238983, 0.4081231653690338, 0.3494420051574707, 0.9992444515228271, 0.7860903739929199, 0.9979307055473328, 0.7222709655761719, 0.8010189533233643, 0.8013852834701538, 0.9999955892562866, 0.6279980540275574, 0.866672933101654, 0.6004093885421753, 0.5577956438064575, 0.9999852180480957, 0.8264089226722717, 0.6667026877403259, 0.9771587252616882, 0.732763409614563, 0.9990246295928955, 0.9992296695709229, 0.9859799146652222, 0.9979220032691956, 0.6700094938278198, 0.5340036153793335, 0.9850856065750122, 0.9837397933006287, 0.6399552226066589, 0.9936529397964478, 0.5348839163780212, 1.0, 0.9814820289611816, 0.9370616674423218, 0.756077766418457, 0.7123000621795654, 0.5086652040481567, 0.8531050682067871, 0.9544190764427185, 0.9947817921638489, 0.999999463558197, 0.9881640076637268, 0.3997061848640442, 0.6820274591445923, 0.999989926815033, 0.9999999403953552, 0.18883386254310608, 0.9999727606773376, 0.998988687992096, 0.9816455245018005, 0.9064837694168091, 0.9851564168930054, 0.9667441844940186, 0.27106356620788574, 0.9461876153945923, 0.9340199828147888, 0.7711870074272156, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9999839663505554, 0.39792996644973755, 0.45100098848342896, 0.8075169920921326, 0.9711480140686035, 0.38888993859291077, 0.8862283229827881, 0.6436619162559509, 0.6263669729232788, 0.6826562285423279, 0.9999387860298157, 0.9742895364761353, 0.5117906332015991, 0.5894151926040649, 0.9983626008033752, 0.9997166991233826, 0.5591335892677307, 0.9999989867210388, 0.5549460649490356, 0.9207108020782471, 0.9875142574310303, 0.9994386434555054, 0.7629454731941223], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.9949847459793091}

For instance, the Trump administration's disregard for the environment is evident in their decision to cut down trees by the river, leading to polluted erosion. Meanwhile, factory farming, which is horrendously evil and cruel, is destroying the planet with climate change. The lack of concern for the welfare of non-human animals and the environment is truly disheartening. Furthermore, the misinformation spread about electric vehicles being environmentally friendly is grossly misinformed. The delay in creating affordable housing in liberal cities is a clear example of unsociable behavior. The violence in regions like Niger Republic is becoming more vicious and violent, interlinked with environmental stressors. The increasing air pollution is a dangerous situation, and if it is not reduced by 2030, it will be necessary to use oxygen kits to breathe without difficulty.

For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security.
