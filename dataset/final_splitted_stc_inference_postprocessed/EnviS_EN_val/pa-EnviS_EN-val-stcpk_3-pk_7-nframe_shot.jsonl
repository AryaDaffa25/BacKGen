Therefore, the phrase 'his own ambition' is likely to be a negative sentiment in this context.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "his", "own", "amb", "ition", "'", "is", "most", "likely", "to", "have", "a", "negative", "con", "notation", "when", "considered", "in", "the", "context", "of", "the", "provided", "text", "and", "the", "background", "knowledge", ".", "The", "text", "describes", "the", "individual", "as", "a", "'", "big", "government", "big", "spend", "net", "zero", "b", "um", "bler", "'", "who", "'", "sort", "a", "got", "bre", "xit", "done", "but", "blew", "it", "with", "lock", "down", "expert", "advis", "ors", "'.", "This", "character", "ization", "implies", "that", "the", "individual", "'", "s", "actions", "were", "self", "-", "serv", "ing", "and", "det", "r", "imental", "to", "the", "greater", "good", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "further", "rein", "for", "ces", "this", "interpretation", ",", "as", "it", "consistently", "highlights", "the", "negative", "consequences", "of", "self", "-", "interest", "and", "the", "prior", "it", "ization", "of", "profit", "over", "the", "well", "-", "being", "of", "people", "and", "the", "planet", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "phrase", "'", "his", "own", "amb", "ition", "'", "is", "likely", "to", "be", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "in", "this", "context", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9197258949279785, 0.5653346180915833, 0.9999983906745911, 0.6057305932044983, 0.8989090919494629, 0.9868020415306091, 0.9999561905860901, 0.9999978542327881, 0.9972180724143982, 0.8660200238227844, 0.8008958101272583, 0.5475496053695679, 0.9997386336326599, 0.6853711605072021, 0.9999746680259705, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9999949336051941, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9977880120277405, 0.25714337825775146, 0.24969792366027832, 0.9828256368637085, 0.5825222730636597, 0.5388904213905334, 0.9662936329841614, 0.9999552965164185, 0.8220850825309753, 0.9999847412109375, 0.21249739825725555, 0.337552547454834, 0.7538996338844299, 0.8846613168716431, 0.9052155017852783, 0.9588142037391663, 0.9685084819793701, 0.5963543653488159, 0.7132282257080078, 0.5899761915206909, 0.5222723484039307, 0.904655933380127, 0.9856517314910889, 0.9084054231643677, 0.7239561080932617, 0.504785418510437, 0.34793126583099365, 0.6950572729110718, 0.5795149803161621, 0.9177187085151672, 0.9336293339729309, 0.977599024772644, 0.9906566143035889, 0.949877917766571, 0.8951562643051147, 0.99709552526474, 0.9931301474571228, 0.9997873902320862, 0.9999368786811829, 0.999940812587738, 0.9999664425849915, 0.6997861862182617, 0.7782943248748779, 0.511067271232605, 0.48557522892951965, 0.9995667338371277, 0.999510645866394, 0.9913319945335388, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9999960660934448, 0.9972617030143738, 0.9983457922935486, 0.9999977350234985, 0.9991319179534912, 0.9999805092811584, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9999590516090393, 0.9999783039093018, 0.9999674558639526, 0.661969780921936, 0.43934860825538635, 0.2804940342903137, 0.9982742071151733, 0.20625430345535278, 0.4578363597393036, 0.8454785346984863, 0.5215219259262085, 0.36574310064315796, 0.9999938607215881, 0.7236114740371704, 0.3028395175933838, 0.2544391453266144, 0.9999952912330627, 0.9783790111541748, 0.9999979138374329, 0.8691834807395935, 0.28324127197265625, 0.999920129776001, 0.9999691247940063, 0.8238198161125183, 0.8197651505470276, 0.586138129234314, 0.998077392578125, 0.7509639859199524, 0.4801073372364044, 0.8710135221481323, 0.9926290512084961, 0.3042680025100708, 0.3779151439666748, 0.9999929070472717, 0.9999997019767761, 0.5656574964523315, 0.3726728856563568, 0.6528933644294739, 0.7052342891693115, 0.9610479474067688, 0.174061119556427, 0.22348129749298096, 0.9017083048820496, 0.9862868785858154, 0.7667537927627563, 0.9650304913520813, 0.2985365092754364, 0.9999886155128479, 0.7536129951477051, 0.76434725522995, 0.505797266960144, 0.4691688120365143, 0.9999931454658508, 0.998747706413269, 0.9999995231628418, 0.46091073751449585, 0.6788087487220764, 0.7949562072753906, 0.6548070311546326, 0.9987202286720276, 0.9999904632568359, 0.999987006187439, 0.6532560586929321, 0.9999517202377319, 0.9999566674232483, 0.96253502368927, 0.9994065761566162, 0.31883999705314636, 0.9999955296516418, 0.6809631586074829, 0.4320386052131653, 0.9988248944282532, 0.9999964237213135, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9999948740005493, 0.9999999403953552, 0.983273983001709, 0.7169176936149597, 0.7233332991600037, 0.982215404510498, 0.35723698139190674, 0.29125723242759705, 0.42405155301094055, 0.4136539399623871, 0.2853519916534424, 0.8567122220993042, 0.9948157072067261, 0.9158473610877991, 0.9511874914169312], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.5653346180915833}

From investing in soil health to reducing waste, and from promoting efficient use of resources to focusing on renewable energy, there are numerous initiatives that are making a positive impact. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6.

Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase is 'negative'.\n\nExplanation:\nThe target phrase 'unprecedented action' indicates a large-scale and extraordinary effort to achieve a goal. The background knowledge, which is predominantly negative in sentiment, suggests that such an effort may be met with resistance or difficulty.

This negation implies that the GOP politics consistently prioritize tax cuts for the wealthy over public improvements, which is a negative sentiment towards their priorities and actions.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "word", "'", "never", "'", "is", "a", "neg", "ation", "that", "challenges", "the", "assumption", "that", "certain", "actions", "or", "policies", "are", "always", "in", "place", "or", "favor", "able", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "background", "knowledge", "indicates", "that", "neg", "ations", "can", "reflect", "a", "general", "sentiment", "of", "ske", "ptic", "ism", "and", "opposition", "towards", "various", "ideas", ",", "policies", ",", "and", "practices", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "use", "of", "the", "word", "'", "never", "'", "in", "the", "text", "can", "be", "seen", "as", "negative", "because", "it", "challenges", "the", "assumption", "that", "certain", "actions", "or", "policies", "are", "always", "favor", "able", "or", "effective", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "the", "text", "states", "that", "'", "g", "op", "politics", "never", "favor", "public", "improvements", "only", "tax", "cuts", "for", "wealthy", "'.", "This", "neg", "ation", "implies", "that", "the", "G", "OP", "politics", "consistently", "prior", "itize", "tax", "cuts", "for", "the", "wealthy", "over", "public", "improvements", ",", "which", "is", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "their", "priorities", "and", "actions", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9149125814437866, 0.5241298675537109, 0.9999986290931702, 0.46097418665885925, 0.8537659645080566, 0.9843131899833679, 0.9999364018440247, 0.9999057054519653, 0.9970177412033081, 0.77366703748703, 0.7669855952262878, 0.5748535394668579, 0.997208833694458, 0.999951183795929, 0.9989539384841919, 0.3927163779735565, 0.8361973762512207, 0.6711298823356628, 0.9629743099212646, 0.3719744086265564, 0.33560702204704285, 0.784369707107544, 0.6218662858009338, 0.5973832011222839, 0.2870560586452484, 0.8158004283905029, 0.6706087589263916, 0.4429643750190735, 0.45891863107681274, 0.44135260581970215, 0.2594752311706543, 0.3939886689186096, 0.6006397008895874, 0.40065568685531616, 0.9981735944747925, 0.984250009059906, 0.834502100944519, 0.5705058574676514, 0.8240534067153931, 0.9995588660240173, 0.8044896125793457, 0.6111140847206116, 0.9684935212135315, 0.33260485529899597, 0.9064751863479614, 0.9425466656684875, 0.9997391104698181, 0.2505289912223816, 0.44740158319473267, 0.9679260849952698, 0.7409003376960754, 0.9999247193336487, 0.9999957084655762, 0.7255060076713562, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9999909996986389, 0.8080980181694031, 0.9992141723632812, 0.9152793288230896, 0.9437135457992554, 0.9442447423934937, 0.8057690858840942, 0.9926611185073853, 0.9998260140419006, 0.8940639495849609, 0.9995648860931396, 0.8952803611755371, 0.5051815509796143, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9539797902107239, 0.3177453577518463, 0.9999995231628418, 0.5581123232841492, 0.7806254029273987, 0.9999948740005493, 0.9999886155128479, 0.9998786449432373, 0.8403286933898926, 0.821988582611084, 0.48262959718704224, 0.5137973427772522, 0.9993524551391602, 0.9033085703849792, 0.9999887943267822, 0.8345357775688171, 0.8255286812782288, 0.9999729990959167, 0.8259844183921814, 0.9992522597312927, 0.8070940375328064, 0.9953527450561523, 0.3344052731990814, 0.46148017048835754, 0.8607783913612366, 0.9793710708618164, 0.5785297155380249, 0.8236109018325806, 0.5356498956680298, 0.998296320438385, 0.6055665016174316, 0.39446502923965454, 0.8175076246261597, 0.4642274081707001, 0.6513768434524536, 0.6972903609275818, 0.9998621940612793, 0.9640279412269592, 0.7561436891555786, 0.5766012668609619, 0.9880246520042419, 0.912193238735199, 0.9007813334465027, 0.9999825954437256, 0.9996705651283264, 0.9884508848190308, 0.9974616765975952, 0.9999801516532898, 0.9999374151229858, 0.9720544815063477, 0.9999926090240479, 0.9999926090240479, 0.9999377727508545, 0.9959009289741516, 0.33379828929901123, 0.9331362843513489, 0.34062308073043823, 0.997487485408783, 0.4871620237827301, 0.9829570055007935, 0.4814954996109009, 0.63197261095047, 0.9999962449073792, 0.6197988390922546, 0.5118136405944824, 0.5246213674545288, 0.9993325471878052, 0.9991002678871155, 0.9999879002571106, 0.8681570291519165, 0.9956609606742859, 0.9997261166572571, 0.9785680770874023, 0.979881227016449, 0.9995357394218445, 0.9871580004692078, 0.8990874290466309, 0.41584575176239014, 0.991065502166748, 0.8421798944473267, 0.7607647776603699, 0.974653959274292, 0.5553460121154785, 0.2971268594264984, 0.9502306580543518, 0.5323725938796997, 0.9995924234390259, 0.9456806778907776], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.5241298675537109}

From investing in soil health to reducing waste, and from promoting efficient use of resources to focusing on renewable energy, there are numerous initiatives that are making a positive impact. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security. Moreover, focusing on reusables and recycling, instead of just paying to dump rubbish, is a more sustainable and necessary approach to waste management.

Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations.

The environment, which once led to growth and a better future, now only brings scarcity and uncertainty.", "The world is filled with various issues that threaten our health and environment, from the consumption of unhealthy and potentially dangerous foods to the destruction of natural habitats and the worsening of water scarcity. Despite the availability of clean and reliable energy sources like nuclear power, many continue to support and prioritize renewable energy, which is not only expensive but also detrimental to the climate. The exploitation of land and resources, as well as the introduction of genetically modified organisms, have led to the contamination of our food and water, causing diseases and health issues. The lack of awareness and education about the differences in food production and the importance of soil and plant science only adds to the problem. The situation is further complicated by the profit-driven green industry that thrives on the fear of a climate emergency, and the misuse of land and resources by governments and corporations. The future looks bleak as climate change continues to spiral out of control, and the support for unsustainable practices and policies only worsens the situation.", "The use of certain facilities and locations, such as prisons and farms, can lead to negative consequences and harm to individuals and communities. The poor quality of food in a prison in Bahrain has led to young detainees refusing meals due to budgetary constraints. This situation is a clear example of how the use of a facility can negatively impact the lives of those within it. Additionally, the existence of evil plantations and broken deals in certain locations, such as farms in Ukraine, can lead to pollution and other harmful practices. These issues can have far-reaching consequences and negatively impact the lives of those affected. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the potential negative consequences that can arise from the use of certain facilities and locations, and to take steps to mitigate these issues whenever possible.", "It's disheartening to see how certain individuals and groups are trying to force their beliefs and agendas upon others, disregarding personal freedom and democracy.

From comparing ministries to sewage systems, to intentionally releasing methane into the atmosphere for personal gain, the disregard for the natural world and its ecosystem services is alarming. These actions, if executed, would lead us down a dangerous path towards extinction, the opposite of defending nature.

For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security.

The good news is that there are eco-friendly alternatives, such as recycled plastic boxes, that are easy to use and discard, making it a win-win situation for both businesses and the planet.

However, in the provided text, the farmers' 'do not' is not a simple refusal, but rather a statement of their concerns and objections towards specific GMOs and corporations. The farmers are not against GMOs in general, but rather against those that cause harm to them and their crops. Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase should be considered in the context of the overall sentiment expressed in the text. In this case, the text conveys a negative sentiment towards the corporations and their practices, which is consistent with the farmers' concerns.

These misguided decisions, driven by profit motives and disregard for the truth, have only served to further damage the already fragile state of our planet. The denial of permission to ban harmful practices and the approval of detrimental initiatives by various authorities have only compounded the problem. It is disheartening to see how short-sightedness and greed continue to dominate over common sense and the well-being of our world.", "In today's world, where various changes are taking place, it's heartening to see individuals and organizations taking steps towards a more sustainable future. From investing in soil health to reducing waste, and from promoting efficient use of resources to focusing on renewable energy, there are numerous initiatives that are making a positive impact. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations.

From investing in soil health to reducing waste, and from promoting efficient use of resources to focusing on renewable energy, there are numerous initiatives that are making a positive impact. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations.

Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase is negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "cl", "imate", "change", "is", "another", "fabric", "ated", "lie", "to", "control", "profits", "gain", "power", "over", "humanity", "so", "ax", "e", "the", "carbon", "tax", "'", "express", "es", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "climate", "change", "and", "the", "actions", "being", "taken", "to", "address", "it", ".", "The", "phrase", "implies", "that", "climate", "change", "is", "not", "a", "real", "issue", ",", "but", "rather", "a", "manip", "ulation", "used", "to", "gain", "control", "and", "profits", ".", "This", "sentiment", "is", "consistent", "with", "the", "negative", "background", "sentences", "that", "express", "frustration", "and", "ske", "ptic", "ism", "towards", "the", "actions", "being", "taken", "to", "address", "various", "issues", ",", "including", "climate", "change", ".", "The", "use", "of", "the", "phrase", "'", "fab", "ric", "ated", "lie", "'", "and", "the", "call", "to", "'", "ax", "e", "the", "carbon", "tax", "'", "further", "emphas", "izes", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "climate", "change", "and", "the", "actions", "being", "taken", "to", "address", "it", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "pol", "arity", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "is", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.96540367603302, 0.5020207762718201, 0.8059284687042236, 0.999817430973053, 0.32342901825904846, 0.9999112486839294, 0.999997079372406, 0.9999970197677612, 0.999999463558197, 0.9999865293502808, 0.9999879002571106, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999949336051941, 0.9990620017051697, 0.9999976754188538, 0.9999370574951172, 0.9999310374259949, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9999973177909851, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9995827674865723, 0.9999653697013855, 0.9999929070472717, 0.9999943971633911, 0.9999794363975525, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9992857575416565, 0.3321956396102905, 0.9999751448631287, 0.9826254844665527, 0.949080228805542, 0.9682403802871704, 0.9740917682647705, 0.6933398246765137, 0.9999435544013977, 0.5837895274162292, 0.7693263292312622, 0.23881807923316956, 0.5880544185638428, 0.9998330473899841, 0.9970883727073669, 0.7384324669837952, 0.9994953274726868, 0.6158157587051392, 0.8915987610816956, 0.3351357877254486, 0.599626362323761, 0.9897683262825012, 0.38183483481407166, 0.9999068975448608, 0.9944562315940857, 0.6961601376533508, 0.9249939322471619, 0.7965356111526489, 0.8725419044494629, 0.5279418230056763, 0.8060457110404968, 0.9560018181800842, 0.9963825941085815, 0.28014734387397766, 0.9825973510742188, 0.47708606719970703, 0.6827130317687988, 0.6563577055931091, 0.34246036410331726, 0.9953654408454895, 0.4994235634803772, 0.8928455114364624, 0.495078980922699, 0.38548845052719116, 0.7162442803382874, 0.46107202768325806, 0.9999960064888, 0.8106663227081299, 0.8233218193054199, 0.6782439351081848, 0.4546996057033539, 0.5386568903923035, 0.8445449471473694, 0.38477665185928345, 0.8133609294891357, 0.4305265247821808, 0.9999976754188538, 0.9999949336051941, 0.9477907419204712, 0.49682921171188354, 0.7203282713890076, 0.5556162595748901, 0.9999469518661499, 0.9781319499015808, 0.9975767731666565, 0.5249924659729004, 0.9490528106689453, 0.9856837391853333, 0.9834441542625427, 0.9949173331260681, 0.999993622303009, 0.8588692545890808, 0.39628133177757263, 0.21057119965553284, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9152146577835083, 0.40955010056495667, 0.9221436381340027, 0.9685726165771484, 1.0, 0.9999964237213135, 0.9998708963394165, 0.9999626874923706, 0.2793019413948059, 0.7916115522384644, 0.8320351243019104, 0.9971283078193665, 0.9611889719963074, 0.9991369843482971, 0.9999725818634033, 0.7973744869232178, 0.9999791383743286, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9965210556983948, 0.7466242909431458, 0.3304576575756073, 0.9856052398681641, 0.5180649161338806, 0.981622576713562, 0.8356012105941772, 0.706550121307373, 0.393454372882843, 0.9970949292182922, 0.9246575832366943, 0.9729487299919128, 0.8856167793273926, 0.9920949935913086, 0.9999316334724426, 0.9998162984848022, 0.8152220845222473, 0.999963104724884, 0.9886704087257385, 0.565625011920929, 0.9999791979789734, 0.9890782237052917, 0.6872029304504395, 0.9999978542327881, 0.9476264715194702, 0.9936119318008423, 0.9989156126976013, 0.9999291896820068, 0.9932714104652405, 0.6003273725509644, 0.9998882412910461, 0.6454765796661377], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.949080228805542}

The background knowledge does not directly relate to this situation, but it does provide a general sense of frustration and negativity towards the taking away of things and the feeling of getting less than what one puts in. This sentiment may be applicable to the situation with the SpaceX satellites, but it is not the main focus of the text. Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase is negative, as indicated in the text.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "negative", "'", "is", "indeed", "negative", "in", "context", ".", "The", "text", "ment", "ions", "that", "there", "are", "problems", "with", "Space", "X", "satell", "ites", "being", "too", "bright", ",", "making", "it", "hard", "for", "astronom", "ers", "to", "see", "farther", "away", "objects", "in", "space", ".", "This", "is", "a", "negative", "issue", "for", "the", "astronom", "ers", "and", "their", "work", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "does", "not", "directly", "relate", "to", "this", "situation", ",", "but", "it", "does", "provide", "a", "general", "sense", "of", "frustration", "and", "neg", "ativity", "towards", "the", "taking", "away", "of", "things", "and", "the", "feeling", "of", "getting", "less", "than", "what", "one", "puts", "in", ".", "This", "sentiment", "may", "be", "applicable", "to", "the", "situation", "with", "the", "Space", "X", "satell", "ites", ",", "but", "it", "is", "not", "the", "main", "focus", "of", "the", "text", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "pol", "arity", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "is", "negative", ",", "as", "indicated", "in", "the", "text", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9659632444381714, 0.7243757843971252, 0.547084629535675, 0.9766079783439636, 0.9019173979759216, 0.9999321699142456, 0.9996067881584167, 0.4721507132053375, 0.2269657701253891, 0.510298490524292, 0.8639777898788452, 0.36901330947875977, 0.6903803944587708, 0.8046465516090393, 0.45807889103889465, 0.3910691738128662, 0.9999996423721313, 0.33105218410491943, 0.8470224738121033, 0.7533230185508728, 0.7148026823997498, 0.8554697036743164, 0.8005052208900452, 0.9999477863311768, 0.9878968596458435, 0.9999821186065674, 0.9326004385948181, 0.8158959150314331, 0.9999653697013855, 0.6562445163726807, 0.6752137541770935, 0.999628484249115, 0.7261160016059875, 0.9894874691963196, 0.9982860684394836, 1.0, 0.9999017119407654, 0.8941857814788818, 0.3602965772151947, 0.9963176250457764, 0.4206152856349945, 0.9985542893409729, 0.9999740719795227, 0.9843352437019348, 0.5874944925308228, 0.43796613812446594, 0.7885536551475525, 0.3040454089641571, 0.5196302533149719, 0.3116139769554138, 0.5704878568649292, 0.5736717581748962, 0.9432443380355835, 0.5287935137748718, 0.6681204438209534, 0.5438879728317261, 0.8662416338920593, 0.5897714495658875, 0.5026360154151917, 0.9644811153411865, 0.5816677808761597, 0.9826493263244629, 0.4903483986854553, 0.45088696479797363, 0.9998273253440857, 0.5198518633842468, 0.6346287727355957, 0.5699143409729004, 0.9241490960121155, 0.6978211402893066, 0.4677945077419281, 0.2968381345272064, 0.5870956778526306, 0.6666383147239685, 0.3241185247898102, 0.9888756275177002, 0.7917314171791077, 0.989493727684021, 0.832685649394989, 0.9979807138442993, 0.3231896460056305, 0.7158163189888, 0.5951341986656189, 0.999829113483429, 0.9612516760826111, 0.9843930602073669, 0.6390098929405212, 0.5254848599433899, 0.7867360711097717, 0.9999892115592957, 0.9024730920791626, 0.9991115927696228, 0.9995942115783691, 0.9627678990364075, 0.9078449010848999, 0.9491674900054932, 0.9999902844429016, 0.729436457157135, 0.5744987726211548, 0.5767532587051392, 0.2977132201194763, 0.41301557421684265, 0.1677025854587555, 0.9888058304786682, 0.9864453077316284, 0.5483179688453674, 0.8788052201271057, 0.9466348886489868, 0.9825164079666138, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9998651146888733, 0.9992669820785522, 0.9317498803138733, 0.5879560112953186, 0.9390500783920288, 0.7171752452850342, 0.9938555955886841, 0.5725651979446411, 0.4196605980396271, 0.6583018898963928, 0.9506579041481018, 0.9999038577079773, 0.9960495233535767, 0.6953533291816711, 0.6182289123535156, 0.9998582005500793, 0.9473068714141846, 0.43623530864715576, 0.9999977350234985, 0.8175812363624573, 0.9644632339477539, 0.9864474534988403, 0.9998412728309631, 0.6463294625282288, 0.6839982867240906, 0.4935733675956726, 0.49880659580230713, 0.36303606629371643, 0.5386707782745361, 0.9999896883964539, 0.9989656209945679, 0.9248132109642029, 0.7870382070541382], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.9999321699142456}

From investing in soil health to reducing waste, and from promoting efficient use of resources to focusing on renewable energy, there are numerous initiatives that are making a positive impact. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security. Moreover, focusing on reusables and recycling, instead of just paying to dump rubbish, is a more sustainable and necessary approach to waste management. It's encouraging to see that individuals and organizations are recognizing the importance of these steps and taking action", "The human stories at the heart of environmental conflicts are located in various places, from the United Kingdom to real estate events and even our own backyards.

For instance, India's commitment to reducing its emission intensity by 24% in 11 years is a significant achievement, and the invention of the world's first dual waste collection truck is a step in the right direction towards minimizing plastic waste. Additionally, the transformation of companies from producing biofuels to making nutraceuticals and other high-value products demonstrates the potential for innovation and adaptation in response to changing needs and priorities.

For instance, the Trump administration's disregard for the environment is evident in their decision to cut down trees by the river, leading to polluted erosion. Meanwhile, factory farming, which is horrendously evil and cruel, is destroying the planet with climate change. The lack of concern for the welfare of non-human animals and the environment is truly disheartening. Furthermore, the misinformation spread about electric vehicles being environmentally friendly is grossly misinformed. The delay in creating affordable housing in liberal cities is a clear example of unsociable behavior. The violence in regions like Niger Republic is becoming more vicious and violent, interlinked with environmental stressors. The increasing air pollution is a dangerous situation, and if it is not reduced by 2030, it will be necessary to use oxygen kits to breathe without difficulty.

From investing in soil health to reducing waste, and from promoting efficient use of resources to focusing on renewable energy, there are numerous initiatives that are making a positive impact. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security.

From investing in soil health to reducing waste, and from promoting efficient use of resources to focusing on renewable energy, there are numerous initiatives that are making a positive impact. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations.

The negative sentiments in the background knowledge do not detract from this interpretation, as they focus on the harm that is being done to the Earth and the need to address these issues, rather than diminishing the value of the Earth itself.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "worth", "saving", "'", "is", "a", "positive", "indicator", ".", "The", "context", "of", "the", "text", "suggests", "that", "the", "speaker", "is", "discussing", "the", "need", "to", "save", "the", "Earth", "from", "some", "sort", "of", "danger", ",", "and", "the", "phrase", "'", "worth", "saving", "'", "implies", "that", "the", "Earth", "is", "valuable", "and", "worth", "preserv", "ing", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "also", "supports", "this", "interpretation", ",", "as", "it", "highlights", "the", "importance", "of", "preserv", "ing", "the", "planet", "and", "its", "inhabitants", ".", "The", "negative", "sent", "iments", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", "do", "not", "det", "ract", "from", "this", "interpretation", ",", "as", "they", "focus", "on", "the", "harm", "that", "is", "being", "done", "to", "the", "Earth", "and", "the", "need", "to", "address", "these", "issues", ",", "rather", "than", "dimin", "ishing", "the", "value", "of", "the", "Earth", "itself", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9766607284545898, 0.7195371985435486, 0.7036699056625366, 0.999384880065918, 0.8603292107582092, 0.9980416297912598, 0.9999887943267822, 0.9986453056335449, 0.35019728541374207, 0.3225739896297455, 0.8585415482521057, 0.2636379301548004, 0.2906710207462311, 0.5335214138031006, 0.2897157669067383, 0.4087204039096832, 0.9610074758529663, 0.4888918697834015, 0.3703279197216034, 0.9102729558944702, 0.3927861154079437, 0.6550032496452332, 0.8843680024147034, 0.3450961410999298, 0.6262970566749573, 0.5523583889007568, 0.9936563968658447, 0.5886663794517517, 0.7977433800697327, 0.841812252998352, 0.4427242577075958, 0.4127354621887207, 0.2786661386489868, 0.999987006187439, 0.37608444690704346, 0.3389052152633667, 0.22743076086044312, 0.9263256788253784, 0.6539837718009949, 0.9882824420928955, 0.772080659866333, 0.9999808073043823, 0.9999794960021973, 0.6599791646003723, 0.9619512557983398, 0.9870184063911438, 0.9465039372444153, 0.6027984619140625, 0.6559038162231445, 0.9673835039138794, 0.31346598267555237, 0.5190700888633728, 0.9997774362564087, 0.9846451878547668, 0.5627831220626831, 0.4619055390357971, 0.9758147597312927, 0.4152980446815491, 0.7426297664642334, 0.86212158203125, 0.6585984826087952, 0.8976913690567017, 0.8422346711158752, 0.9201806783676147, 0.36090511083602905, 0.6086389422416687, 0.8963124752044678, 0.9986744523048401, 0.9126719236373901, 0.9986976385116577, 0.8189879655838013, 0.5435097813606262, 0.7383929491043091, 0.782687783241272, 0.9978500008583069, 0.795357346534729, 0.41347458958625793, 0.8377146124839783, 0.5658926963806152, 0.9999640583992004, 0.9121638536453247, 0.9786715507507324, 0.9996200799942017, 0.9947298765182495, 0.20494040846824646, 0.9995623230934143, 0.329863578081131, 0.9999948740005493, 0.9999849200248718, 0.8032037019729614, 0.6310182213783264, 0.9716770648956299, 0.9534098505973816, 0.9417222738265991, 0.17507962882518768, 0.9946693778038025, 0.9296847581863403, 0.5793282985687256, 0.40801072120666504, 0.6800764799118042, 0.8879938721656799, 0.8790506720542908, 0.8530498147010803, 0.9999918341636658, 0.799128532409668, 0.589748740196228, 0.9364821314811707, 0.8001440763473511, 0.8998285531997681, 0.9873653650283813, 0.5481987595558167, 0.9944413304328918, 0.7120549082756042, 0.9937724471092224, 0.999997079372406, 0.34848448634147644, 0.999994695186615, 0.9177709221839905, 0.8940047025680542, 0.9762142896652222, 0.9985551238059998, 0.9994341731071472, 0.9990614056587219, 0.9994797110557556, 0.35993799567222595], "st_polarity_prediction": "positive", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.8585415482521057}

The positive background knowledge emphasizes the importance of reducing greenhouse gases and making informed decisions for a more sustainable future, which further highlights the negative impact of black fossil fuels.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "term", "'", "black", "foss", "il", "fuel", "'", "is", "generally", "considered", "to", "have", "a", "negative", "pol", "arity", ".", "The", "reason", "for", "this", "classification", "is", "that", "foss", "il", "fu", "els", ",", "including", "coal", ",", "are", "major", "contributors", "to", "green", "house", "gas", "emissions", ",", "which", "are", "a", "significant", "cause", "of", "climate", "change", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "does", "not", "directly", "mention", "coal", "or", "foss", "il", "fu", "els", ",", "but", "the", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", "is", "generally", "negative", "towards", "the", "environmental", "impact", "of", "these", "energy", "sources", ".", "The", "positive", "background", "knowledge", "emphas", "izes", "the", "importance", "of", "reducing", "green", "house", "g", "ases", "and", "making", "informed", "decisions", "for", "a", "more", "sustainable", "future", ",", "which", "further", "highlights", "the", "negative", "impact", "of", "black", "foss", "il", "fu", "els", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9518688321113586, 0.4422357678413391, 0.622821569442749, 0.9890686869621277, 0.999835729598999, 0.999992311000824, 1.0, 0.9998232126235962, 0.9869605302810669, 0.3873913586139679, 0.4640684127807617, 0.763931393623352, 0.45936399698257446, 0.5149418711662292, 0.9970929622650146, 0.9517471790313721, 0.5824880599975586, 0.999998152256012, 0.34576326608657837, 0.338111013174057, 0.17689797282218933, 0.4235876798629761, 0.9832265973091125, 0.8012552857398987, 0.8300545811653137, 0.879650890827179, 0.42457208037376404, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9996716976165771, 0.9999992251396179, 0.8766897320747375, 0.3574858605861664, 0.9599139094352722, 0.8714587688446045, 0.8520625829696655, 0.2744799256324768, 0.9785879254341125, 0.9988436698913574, 0.9812297821044922, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9899506568908691, 0.998788595199585, 0.6265829801559448, 0.5642582178115845, 0.21853294968605042, 0.3570133149623871, 0.49132442474365234, 0.5000507831573486, 0.999466598033905, 0.9601262211799622, 0.9999669790267944, 0.8783104419708252, 0.5715219974517822, 0.6688528060913086, 0.9466124773025513, 0.3135194182395935, 0.9618598818778992, 0.4024772346019745, 0.5426708459854126, 0.5493011474609375, 0.9899821281433105, 0.5559328198432922, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9998188018798828, 1.0, 0.6754683256149292, 0.9919819235801697, 0.6446832418441772, 0.5917970538139343, 0.29858994483947754, 0.8996348977088928, 0.7691771984100342, 0.606503427028656, 0.43787842988967896, 0.8434925675392151, 0.680282473564148, 0.6121108531951904, 0.4569019675254822, 0.9613646268844604, 0.9941168427467346, 0.36982104182243347, 0.5424111485481262, 0.999718427658081, 0.9597233533859253, 0.3799114227294922, 0.42516908049583435, 0.6742450594902039, 0.6963291764259338, 0.34153348207473755, 0.999453604221344, 0.7487468123435974, 0.891952633857727, 0.9997952580451965, 0.7779362797737122, 0.9836509227752686, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9009200930595398, 0.9999768733978271, 0.9330208897590637, 0.26836609840393066, 0.46319469809532166, 0.9942322373390198, 0.6032620072364807, 0.9917365312576294, 0.9010075926780701, 0.999988853931427, 0.9999038577079773, 0.6211816072463989, 0.49632078409194946, 0.7618638277053833, 0.46419334411621094, 0.9994932413101196, 0.9853283762931824, 0.7701316475868225, 0.9432569742202759, 0.4309251606464386, 0.9999321699142456, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9964519739151001, 1.0, 0.7121734023094177, 0.9269284009933472], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.9517471790313721}

These substances, often produced with harmful chemicals and under questionable labor practices, are causing health issues and environmental damage. The lack of transparency and regulation in the food industry, as well as the prioritization of profits over people's well-being, is a significant problem that needs to be addressed.

For instance, India's commitment to reducing its emission intensity by 24% in 11 years is a significant achievement, and the invention of the world's first dual waste collection truck is a step in the right direction towards minimizing plastic waste. Additionally, the transformation of companies from producing biofuels to making nutraceuticals and other high-value products demonstrates the potential for innovation and adaptation in response to changing needs and priorities.

It's important to remember that the polarity of a target phrase should be determined based on the context and sentiment of the target phrase itself, and not on the sentiment of the background knowledge.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "w", "ants", "a", "bigger", "piece", "of", "this", "market", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "does", "not", "provide", "enough", "information", "to", "determine", "a", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", "for", "the", "target", "phrase", ".", "The", "phrase", "itself", "is", "simply", "a", "statement", "of", "intent", ",", "and", "it", "does", "not", "inher", "ently", "carry", "a", "positive", "or", "negative", "con", "notation", ".", "It", "'", "s", "important", "to", "remember", "that", "the", "pol", "arity", "of", "a", "target", "phrase", "should", "be", "determined", "based", "on", "the", "context", "and", "sentiment", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "itself", ",", "and", "not", "on", "the", "sentiment", "of", "the", "background", "knowledge", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9872860908508301, 0.6781699657440186, 0.8779085874557495, 0.9998225569725037, 0.824718177318573, 0.9995102882385254, 0.9999961853027344, 0.9999860525131226, 0.9999648928642273, 0.9999570250511169, 0.9994012117385864, 0.9994686841964722, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9990185499191284, 0.3791603147983551, 0.7746023535728455, 0.46568819880485535, 0.5901958346366882, 0.458726167678833, 0.7672286033630371, 0.5132865905761719, 0.999517560005188, 0.7907445430755615, 0.4604171812534332, 0.554952085018158, 0.954685389995575, 0.7397547364234924, 0.47403693199157715, 0.7548019886016846, 0.9999957084655762, 0.9999509453773499, 0.9545477628707886, 0.6602959036827087, 0.5005128979682922, 0.9113839268684387, 0.9998309016227722, 0.6664779782295227, 0.52207350730896, 0.3424113094806671, 0.7540019750595093, 0.3753030300140381, 0.34465333819389343, 0.22082601487636566, 0.9628379940986633, 0.7872352004051208, 0.6401624083518982, 0.4421311318874359, 0.5355565547943115, 0.6046532392501831, 0.39558184146881104, 0.9998979568481445, 0.4165344834327698, 0.999980092048645, 0.4917394816875458, 0.7368165254592896, 0.9807383418083191, 0.9999796748161316, 0.9999638199806213, 0.6714444160461426, 0.9999879002571106, 0.9810742735862732, 0.23911941051483154, 0.35513222217559814, 0.9999960064888, 0.8557915091514587, 0.9980742931365967, 0.7102150917053223, 0.9990983605384827, 0.7693192958831787, 0.39909520745277405, 0.9999987483024597, 0.5287915468215942, 0.543755054473877, 0.5394617319107056, 0.9999099969863892, 0.8252345323562622, 0.9564608931541443, 0.8307182788848877, 0.9464657306671143, 0.9878930449485779, 0.9075472950935364, 0.6314250826835632, 0.6097489595413208, 0.45606499910354614, 0.9775356650352478, 0.9988649487495422, 0.2410816252231598, 0.9997640252113342, 0.9821459650993347, 0.9584397673606873, 0.45218053460121155, 0.999066174030304, 0.46907612681388855, 0.5980573296546936, 0.5768917202949524, 0.9996278882026672, 0.7960533499717712, 0.9162738919258118, 0.9868054389953613, 0.8669822216033936, 0.751649796962738], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.7746023535728455}
