The examples provided do not directly relate to the target phrase, but they do demonstrate the importance of considering the overall sentiment of a text when determining polarity.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "un", "expl", "ained", "'", "is", "neutral", "in", "this", "context", ".", "The", "sentence", "as", "a", "whole", "express", "es", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "due", "to", "the", "potential", "environmental", "harm", "caused", "by", "the", "gas", "le", "aks", ".", "However", ",", "the", "pol", "arity", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "itself", "is", "neutral", "because", "it", "does", "not", "inher", "ently", "convey", "positive", "or", "negative", "meaning", ".", "The", "examples", "provided", "do", "not", "directly", "relate", "to", "the", "target", "phrase", ",", "but", "they", "do", "demonstrate", "the", "importance", "of", "considering", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "of", "a", "text", "when", "determining", "pol", "arity", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9407066702842712, 0.5538284778594971, 0.44197356700897217, 0.9783561825752258, 0.9224655032157898, 0.9995438456535339, 0.9999274015426636, 0.9999806880950928, 0.9996281862258911, 0.3894852101802826, 0.8061537742614746, 0.5115585923194885, 0.36278632283210754, 0.9810081124305725, 0.6925655007362366, 0.6290572881698608, 0.35584795475006104, 0.21358413994312286, 0.9993343949317932, 0.9999867677688599, 0.3941178321838379, 0.9999821186065674, 0.5405641794204712, 0.4353720247745514, 0.9965670108795166, 0.37345704436302185, 0.9997914433479309, 0.9722475409507751, 0.7492445111274719, 0.7800412178039551, 0.4867107570171356, 0.7737764716148376, 0.9999784231185913, 0.999049723148346, 0.6214369535446167, 0.9975874423980713, 0.9999995231628418, 0.8020341992378235, 0.9655014872550964, 0.9998544454574585, 0.9714483618736267, 0.23600466549396515, 0.9999958276748657, 0.9965871572494507, 0.77200847864151, 0.856951892375946, 0.9978418350219727, 0.6585490107536316, 0.8588236570358276, 0.4502898156642914, 0.4103078842163086, 0.8548116683959961, 0.7039576172828674, 0.9999499320983887, 0.5417894721031189, 0.99998939037323, 0.4447224736213684, 0.556513249874115, 0.9999659061431885, 0.9999793767929077, 0.3696303963661194, 0.9628620147705078, 0.38522598147392273, 0.39658111333847046, 0.6464065313339233, 0.347622811794281, 0.994047999382019, 0.4097338318824768, 0.33463916182518005, 0.9999806880950928, 0.946253776550293, 0.40597477555274963, 0.9985752105712891, 0.48032885789871216, 0.9351919293403625, 0.9128361344337463, 0.2835206091403961, 0.49097996950149536, 0.4583253264427185, 0.8663318157196045, 0.9999880790710449, 0.9160782098770142, 0.9210553169250488, 0.5199245810508728, 0.8464646935462952, 0.8620701432228088, 0.6519296765327454, 0.7930012941360474, 0.9803040623664856, 0.9171457886695862, 0.6999724507331848, 0.9999992847442627, 0.9887515902519226, 0.5233251452445984], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.8061537742614746}

The reason for this classification is that the phrase implies a hindrance or obstacle to achieving a goal, which is typically associated with a negative sentiment. The examples provided also support this classification, as they contain instances of negative sentiment related to costs and their impact. In example 1, the cost of 20 billion dollars is described as a destruction of productive land, which is a negative outcome. In example 2, the unsafe environment of schools is attributed to their falling apart and the impact on student success is described as undiminishable, which is also negative. Therefore, the negative sentiment associated with costs and their impact on goals aligns with the sentiment of the target phrase.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "phrase", "'", "in", "cre", "ase", "in", "cost", "is", "often", "seen", "as", "a", "road", "block", "'", "is", "negative", ".", "The", "reason", "for", "this", "classification", "is", "that", "the", "phrase", "implies", "a", "hind", "r", "ance", "or", "obst", "acle", "to", "achieving", "a", "goal", ",", "which", "is", "typically", "associated", "with", "a", "negative", "sentiment", ".", "The", "examples", "provided", "also", "support", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "they", "contain", "instances", "of", "negative", "sentiment", "related", "to", "costs", "and", "their", "impact", ".", "In", "example", "", "1", ",", "the", "cost", "of", "", "2", "0", "billion", "dollars", "is", "described", "as", "a", "destruction", "of", "productive", "land", ",", "which", "is", "a", "negative", "outcome", ".", "In", "example", "", "2", ",", "the", "unsafe", "environment", "of", "schools", "is", "attributed", "to", "their", "falling", "apart", "and", "the", "impact", "on", "student", "success", "is", "described", "as", "un", "dim", "in", "ish", "able", ",", "which", "is", "also", "negative", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "associated", "with", "costs", "and", "their", "impact", "on", "goals", "align", "s", "with", "the", "sentiment", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9654536843299866, 0.6058127284049988, 0.41153720021247864, 0.8266764879226685, 0.7158111333847046, 0.9990347623825073, 0.9999979734420776, 0.9999992847442627, 0.999990701675415, 0.9667547345161438, 0.9999866485595703, 0.9999393224716187, 0.9989345669746399, 0.9985558390617371, 0.9999761581420898, 0.9999969005584717, 0.9996659755706787, 0.39810577034950256, 0.4674743413925171, 0.5832204818725586, 0.37983962893486023, 0.1855955570936203, 0.358346551656723, 0.9238360524177551, 0.8248162269592285, 0.9904382824897766, 0.9480145573616028, 0.7786937952041626, 0.34194302558898926, 0.24852903187274933, 0.518851637840271, 0.6701965928077698, 0.9997363686561584, 0.9999963045120239, 0.9129367470741272, 0.8279970288276672, 0.9920055270195007, 0.4908737242221832, 0.28307977318763733, 0.8446197509765625, 0.9772560000419617, 0.7006949186325073, 0.5381275415420532, 0.701998770236969, 0.42951929569244385, 0.5336015224456787, 0.9999909400939941, 0.870954692363739, 0.9990376234054565, 0.9958469271659851, 0.9681597948074341, 0.45712727308273315, 0.3914511203765869, 0.6684533357620239, 0.3270424008369446, 0.39895138144493103, 0.9823175668716431, 0.5467485189437866, 0.841317355632782, 0.7183035016059875, 0.7158277034759521, 0.4375284016132355, 0.3672313988208771, 0.9823527932167053, 0.6331738233566284, 0.7464411854743958, 0.47275620698928833, 0.9999936819076538, 0.6815761923789978, 0.4409557580947876, 0.4729759991168976, 0.8620506525039673, 0.747941792011261, 0.23052117228507996, 0.5843736529350281, 0.9827961325645447, 0.9995303153991699, 0.9994651675224304, 0.913401186466217, 0.9658305048942566, 0.8944494724273682, 0.8459402918815613, 0.9999864101409912, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9999679327011108, 0.9686053991317749, 0.9795982241630554, 0.3847663998603821, 0.8245388269424438, 0.9575204849243164, 0.5099697113037109, 0.610142171382904, 0.8768243193626404, 0.5786988735198975, 0.770442545413971, 0.3090551495552063, 0.7294819951057434, 0.49068281054496765, 0.8387985825538635, 0.4753655195236206, 0.9936631917953491, 0.9351906776428223, 0.9991697072982788, 0.9999961853027344, 0.8396720290184021, 0.9999942779541016, 0.6545723676681519, 0.8924816250801086, 0.9664469957351685, 0.6198214888572693, 0.9028890132904053, 0.9606824517250061, 0.6979216933250427, 0.9837085604667664, 0.5828024744987488, 0.9015368223190308, 0.9999146461486816, 0.9699763655662537, 0.6416089534759521, 0.5678101181983948, 0.6296999454498291, 0.9959855675697327, 0.9999850988388062, 0.8847982883453369, 0.8139559626579285, 0.9987055063247681, 0.26007264852523804, 0.6501055359840393, 0.9992561936378479, 0.7281023263931274, 0.9999994039535522, 0.9887579679489136, 0.633179783821106, 0.4168625771999359, 0.7588469386100769, 0.7675526738166809, 0.9760622382164001, 0.33312875032424927, 0.9999953508377075, 0.9255368709564209, 0.4321276843547821, 0.9215571880340576, 0.5279426574707031, 0.9999966621398926, 0.5500624775886536, 0.7829468250274658, 0.8434321284294128, 0.9594326019287109, 0.3252822160720825, 0.26604118943214417, 0.3686683177947998, 0.9999650716781616, 0.9997928738594055, 0.9999432563781738, 0.5638641119003296, 0.530096709728241, 0.9994530081748962, 0.9929781556129456, 0.9999183416366577, 0.461983859539032, 0.9371177554130554], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.4674743413925171}

While the feasibility of the goal is positive, the requirement for 'unprecedented action' suggests a challenging and potentially difficult undertaking. Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase is 'negative' as it implies a high level of effort and potential hardships, rather than a positive or optimistic outlook.\n\nExplanation:\nThe phrase 'unprecedented action' implies a significant and extraordinary effort to achieve the goal of halving Australia's food waste by 2030. While the feasibility of the goal is positive, the requirement for 'unprecedented action' suggests a challenging and potentially difficult undertaking. The term 'unprecedented' implies that this level of action has not been seen before, and may involve new and untested approaches, or a large-scale mobilization of resources and effort. This level of effort and potential hardships is the reason for the negative polarity classification.\n\nIt's important to note that the sentiment of the overall text is not necessarily indicative",

The examples provided do not directly influence this classification, but they demonstrate the importance of considering the context and sentiment of the target phrase when determining its polarity.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "slash", "g", "h", "g", "emissions", "'", "has", "a", "positive", "pol", "arity", ".", "The", "reason", "for", "this", "classification", "is", "that", "the", "phrase", "implies", "a", "reduction", "or", "decrease", "in", "green", "house", "gas", "emissions", ",", "which", "is", "a", "des", "irable", "outcome", "for", "addressing", "climate", "change", "and", "mit", "ig", "ating", "its", "negative", "impacts", ".", "The", "use", "of", "the", "word", "'", "slash", "'", "suggests", "a", "significant", "reduction", ",", "which", "further", "rein", "for", "ces", "the", "positive", "sentiment", ".", "The", "examples", "provided", "do", "not", "directly", "influence", "this", "classification", ",", "but", "they", "demonstrate", "the", "importance", "of", "considering", "the", "context", "and", "sentiment", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "when", "determining", "its", "pol", "arity", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9428024888038635, 0.834040641784668, 0.8104113936424255, 0.9997995495796204, 0.8622718453407288, 0.9991207718849182, 0.9998548030853271, 0.9999427795410156, 0.9999687671661377, 0.9999722242355347, 0.9997853636741638, 0.2852667570114136, 0.9976646900177002, 0.9996678829193115, 0.9928223490715027, 0.9999985694885254, 0.7689081430435181, 0.3204643726348877, 0.38286757469177246, 0.37810805439949036, 0.9665635824203491, 0.5387426614761353, 0.997107207775116, 0.9761719703674316, 0.8815593719482422, 0.6460974812507629, 0.49784839153289795, 0.9460425972938538, 0.8723046779632568, 0.834298849105835, 0.930488109588623, 0.9758989810943604, 0.9113041162490845, 0.9999880790710449, 0.9866043925285339, 0.8383949995040894, 0.8629719614982605, 0.9791957139968872, 0.9963068962097168, 0.510001540184021, 0.7971866130828857, 0.9999934434890747, 0.7840918898582458, 0.7436183094978333, 0.8786389827728271, 0.9325249195098877, 0.9998668432235718, 0.7282437682151794, 0.47233307361602783, 0.9999819993972778, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9544602632522583, 0.7377498745918274, 0.8593016266822815, 0.7518541216850281, 0.4302099645137787, 0.273567259311676, 0.9999984502792358, 0.9934658408164978, 0.8410141468048096, 0.9999456405639648, 0.9688650369644165, 0.9934967756271362, 0.2231038510799408, 0.9950460195541382, 0.979455828666687, 0.7095019221305847, 0.8670681118965149, 0.2556935250759125, 0.6925555467605591, 0.418485552072525, 0.9999972581863403, 0.9999994039535522, 0.9890533089637756, 0.9997695088386536, 0.9259958863258362, 0.7341033220291138, 0.24263302981853485, 0.5044901967048645, 0.9075207114219666, 0.5024282336235046, 0.9968270659446716, 0.5441734194755554, 0.4587462544441223, 0.7892343997955322, 0.49163487553596497, 0.8423151969909668, 0.8637816905975342, 0.9443168044090271, 0.31836333870887756, 0.49974554777145386, 0.5801736116409302, 0.9993284940719604, 0.8885229229927063, 0.9835734963417053, 0.3025723695755005, 0.9972285628318787, 0.8277962803840637, 0.8914515376091003, 0.8459897637367249, 0.3266558051109314, 0.99953293800354, 0.6204286217689514, 0.96523517370224, 0.9713048338890076, 0.9998983144760132, 0.9999979734420776, 0.9999549388885498, 0.9577015042304993], "st_polarity_prediction": "positive", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.9996678829193115}

In the provided text, the word 'transform' is used in a positive context, as it refers to activists taking abandoned land and turning it into something productive, such as building food sovereignty. Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase 'transform' is positive.\n\nExplanation:\nThe word 'transform' can have both positive and negative connotations depending on the context. In the negative context, it can mean to change something into something worse, such as a transformation of a beautiful landscape into an industrial wasteland. However, in the positive context, it can mean to change something into something better, such as a transformation of a derelict building into a community center.\n\nIn the provided text, the word 'transform' is used in a positive context, as it refers to activists taking abandoned land and turning it into something productive. Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase 'transform' is positive. This is similar to example 3, where the world's first dual waste collection truck is being delivered, which is a positive transformation.\n\n", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "word", "'", "transform",

Overall, the negative sentiment towards zero emission coal energy in the user's statement is clear and consistent with the examples provided.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "hor", "rend", "ously", "expensive", "and", "unre", "li", "able", "'", "express", "es", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "zero", "emission", "coal", "energy", ".", "The", "user", "'", "s", "statement", "implies", "that", "the", "high", "cost", "and", "unre", "li", "ability", "of", "this", "energy", "source", "make", "it", "less", "des", "irable", "or", "un", "at", "tract", "ive", ".", "This", "is", "in", "contrast", "to", "the", "positive", "sentiment", "expressed", "in", "example", "", "3", ",", "where", "the", "electric", "motor", "is", "described", "as", "getting", "a", "'", "hall", "pass", "'", "and", "being", "a", "'", "g", "reat", "example", "'.", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "in", "the", "user", "'", "s", "statement", "is", "also", "consistent", "with", "the", "sentiment", "in", "examples", "", "1", "and", "", "2", ",", "where", "the", "terms", "'", "question", "able", "'", "and", "'", "tax", "ation", "will", "not", "change", "climate", "in", "any", "way", "'", "are", "used", "to", "express", "doubt", "or", "ske", "ptic", "ism", ".", "Overall", ",", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "zero", "emission", "coal", "energy", "in", "the", "user", "'", "s", "statement", "is", "clear", "and", "consistent", "with", "the", "examples", "provided", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9025705456733704, 0.5216010808944702, 0.8756552934646606, 0.9997381567955017, 0.9104337096214294, 0.9998717308044434, 0.9998900890350342, 0.9999886751174927, 0.9999672174453735, 0.999995231628418, 0.9999823570251465, 0.9999932050704956, 1.0, 0.9998757839202881, 0.4327119290828705, 0.9999616146087646, 0.8993101716041565, 0.9854141473770142, 0.9962978959083557, 0.7930797338485718, 0.9565351009368896, 0.9973209500312805, 0.9999774694442749, 0.9999926090240479, 0.911201536655426, 0.45319050550460815, 0.3256460130214691, 0.2956121265888214, 0.9999866485595703, 0.8984643816947937, 0.6341420412063599, 0.9902860522270203, 0.4246564507484436, 0.6502638459205627, 0.9826002717018127, 0.9999922513961792, 0.9761214256286621, 0.9999970197677612, 0.9994910955429077, 0.5653506517410278, 0.6681154370307922, 0.9628394842147827, 0.9886167645454407, 0.5581701993942261, 0.9999932050704956, 0.3338596820831299, 0.9613110423088074, 0.9999998807907104, 0.4153004288673401, 0.1152052953839302, 0.809451699256897, 0.9999921321868896, 0.9999996423721313, 0.7316693067550659, 0.4488600492477417, 0.3005996346473694, 0.4907560348510742, 0.9766665101051331, 0.9965969920158386, 0.8265988826751709, 0.8073474168777466, 0.7807479500770569, 0.861528217792511, 0.7641685605049133, 0.7634914517402649, 0.981366753578186, 0.999705970287323, 0.8013071417808533, 0.9767894148826599, 0.8809210658073425, 0.2502598166465759, 0.999953031539917, 0.8966867923736572, 0.5704949498176575, 0.9946001768112183, 0.50448077917099, 0.979506254196167, 0.9720765948295593, 0.8907498121261597, 0.9999921321868896, 0.9990621209144592, 0.38859856128692627, 0.28987857699394226, 0.9502806067466736, 0.9099434018135071, 0.9998181462287903, 0.9999940395355225, 0.9999454021453857, 0.47994011640548706, 0.33937743306159973, 0.6095108389854431, 0.9722043871879578, 0.767617404460907, 0.8491507172584534, 0.7291160821914673, 0.9973445534706116, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9949289560317993, 0.8741577863693237, 0.5911235213279724, 0.3092441260814667, 0.999998927116394, 0.5766286849975586, 0.533140242099762, 0.6010816097259521, 0.8990908861160278, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9999905824661255, 0.9975372552871704, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9999533891677856, 0.9978971481323242, 0.831307053565979, 0.5491271018981934, 0.6257846355438232, 0.999943733215332, 0.9996832609176636, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9965949654579163, 0.9999502897262573, 0.9999823570251465, 0.6192304491996765, 0.9999982118606567, 0.9947863817214966, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9999425411224365, 0.9998319149017334, 0.9981091022491455, 0.9999914169311523, 0.9999796152114868, 0.9946817755699158, 0.294445663690567, 0.8084033131599426, 0.717529833316803, 0.8941677808761597, 0.4926717281341553, 0.8439735174179077, 0.4965399205684662, 0.9999961853027344, 0.9999922513961792, 0.8691316843032837, 0.4546285569667816, 0.9999974966049194, 0.9967801570892334, 0.43781712651252747, 0.656427800655365, 0.7086236476898193, 0.4692871868610382, 0.999518871307373, 0.9999576807022095, 0.9999879598617554, 0.8473357558250427, 0.9998631477355957, 0.7466280460357666, 0.9999866485595703, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9970946311950684, 0.8136115670204163, 0.6927773952484131, 0.9796366691589355, 0.4316650331020355, 0.9803463220596313, 0.9955384135246277, 0.3004472255706787, 0.9790443778038025, 0.9877298474311829, 0.9937359094619751], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.9854141473770142}

The examples provided also contain negative sentiment towards certain things, which further supports the classification of the target phrase as negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "every", "single", "thing", "we", "ve", "ever", "built", "'", "is", "classified", "as", "negative", ".", "The", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", "does", "not", "directly", "indicate", "the", "pol", "arity", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", ",", "but", "the", "phrase", "itself", "has", "a", "negative", "con", "notation", ".", "The", "phrase", "implies", "that", "there", "may", "be", "a", "problem", "with", "every", "single", "thing", "that", "has", "been", "built", ",", "which", "can", "be", "interpreted", "as", "a", "criticism", "or", "complaint", ".", "The", "examples", "provided", "also", "contain", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "certain", "things", ",", "which", "further", "supports", "the", "classification", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", "as", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9588557481765747, 0.5103406310081482, 0.6084823608398438, 0.9998704195022583, 0.8988516926765442, 0.9999285936355591, 0.999931812286377, 0.9999581575393677, 0.9990311861038208, 0.9931768178939819, 0.9999721050262451, 0.9999837875366211, 0.9994112253189087, 0.3262605369091034, 0.5439897179603577, 0.9999350309371948, 0.8024071455001831, 0.8329562544822693, 0.3677436411380768, 0.29689380526542664, 0.6751531362533569, 0.8776853680610657, 0.5114743709564209, 0.36394941806793213, 0.997611403465271, 0.2613774538040161, 0.3723995089530945, 0.426587849855423, 0.957324743270874, 0.9999988079071045, 0.6369307637214661, 0.9165429472923279, 0.8580288887023926, 0.9997377991676331, 0.6847240924835205, 0.9184315800666809, 0.7765805721282959, 0.2797595262527466, 0.7908843159675598, 0.22613517940044403, 0.9726700186729431, 0.7466563582420349, 0.9329343438148499, 0.9999665021896362, 0.44677865505218506, 0.41833528876304626, 0.5141055583953857, 0.5282698273658752, 0.45923033356666565, 0.5966082811355591, 0.28083091974258423, 0.7040126919746399, 0.4525875449180603, 0.6191412210464478, 0.5819402933120728, 0.41646140813827515, 0.9968252182006836, 0.9975784420967102, 0.8626244068145752, 0.9884964227676392, 0.8682857751846313, 0.9995850920677185, 0.6990812420845032, 0.47259756922721863, 0.31272441148757935, 0.9778587222099304, 0.4934297502040863, 0.9993923902511597, 0.9610689878463745, 0.7935009002685547, 0.9803546071052551, 0.4455605149269104, 0.9492904543876648, 0.28629639744758606, 0.29411739110946655, 0.4665887951850891, 0.47675493359565735, 0.14495068788528442, 0.7996286749839783, 0.5185543894767761, 0.8506531715393066, 0.6406227946281433, 0.5090540647506714, 0.6496660709381104, 0.4443468451499939, 0.3842996060848236, 0.7196131348609924, 0.5487848520278931, 0.42227819561958313, 0.7720863819122314, 0.8295420408248901, 0.9982860684394836, 0.9998469352722168, 0.988387405872345, 0.999902606010437, 0.9996258020401001, 0.8113890290260315], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.8024071455001831}

The sentiment towards 'cancel' in this context is negative, as it is used to criticize and dismiss the importance of responsible investing and sustainability practices.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "cancel", "'", "in", "the", "provided", "text", "is", "classified", "as", "negative", ".", "The", "term", "'", "cancel", "'", "is", "often", "used", "to", "describe", "the", "act", "of", "publicly", "sh", "aming", "or", "boy", "c", "ot", "ting", "someone", "or", "something", ",", "usually", "due", "to", "perceived", "wrong", "do", "ings", "or", "offensive", "behavior", ".", "In", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", ",", "it", "is", "used", "in", "a", "der", "og", "atory", "manner", "to", "label", "E", "SG", "(", "Environment", "al", ",", "Social", ",", "and", "Govern", "ance", ")", "practices", "as", "a", "radical", "agenda", ",", "and", "to", "associate", "it", "with", "negative", "concepts", "such", "as", "affirm", "ative", "action", ",", "critical", "race", "theory", ",", "and", "corporate", "welfare", ".", "The", "sentiment", "towards", "'", "cancel", "'", "in", "this", "context", "is", "negative", ",", "as", "it", "is", "used", "to", "critic", "ize", "and", "dismiss", "the", "importance", "of", "responsible", "investing", "and", "sustain", "ability", "practices", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8151808381080627, 0.5526560544967651, 0.5252129435539246, 0.8887338638305664, 0.9195671677589417, 0.9997223019599915, 0.9965499639511108, 0.20470169186592102, 0.8359420299530029, 0.3542754352092743, 0.9720955491065979, 0.42149385809898376, 0.2723861336708069, 0.9998611211776733, 0.6000113487243652, 0.9423245787620544, 0.3779284656047821, 0.3002067506313324, 0.9728110432624817, 0.9995321035385132, 0.7858232855796814, 0.5762792229652405, 0.7258086204528809, 0.7443254590034485, 0.5458186268806458, 0.5783805847167969, 0.5546953082084656, 0.7077636122703552, 0.9996830224990845, 0.6899843811988831, 0.37269988656044006, 0.9907168745994568, 0.6819565296173096, 0.903706431388855, 0.9999626874923706, 0.9998140931129456, 0.9999780654907227, 0.6009536385536194, 0.42799609899520874, 0.9933844208717346, 0.3842175602912903, 0.23174960911273956, 0.42700833082199097, 0.9999980926513672, 0.8540410399436951, 0.31393906474113464, 0.9879844188690186, 0.6957020163536072, 0.923309326171875, 0.4875190854072571, 0.5336464643478394, 0.9983691573143005, 0.5089797973632812, 0.5871304869651794, 0.5594648718833923, 0.9647393226623535, 0.9925244450569153, 0.5899168848991394, 0.9796702861785889, 0.41459205746650696, 0.6756596565246582, 0.23223845660686493, 0.569328248500824, 0.8437902927398682, 0.49865543842315674, 0.9879723191261292, 0.9874944090843201, 0.5459163784980774, 0.8371018171310425, 0.31395843625068665, 0.8343694806098938, 0.9999953508377075, 0.7031667232513428, 0.9427603483200073, 0.9999351501464844, 0.8096397519111633, 0.999441921710968, 0.9763824939727783, 0.998611569404602, 0.9995653033256531, 0.9999814033508301, 0.9997888207435608, 0.5102891325950623, 0.6822160482406616, 0.6843460202217102, 0.3131469488143921, 0.5119266510009766, 0.2939455807209015, 0.18407940864562988, 0.15306168794631958, 0.4015565514564514, 0.8686132431030273, 0.9996805191040039, 0.5443418622016907, 0.7036257982254028, 0.8017032146453857, 0.999921441078186, 0.4309987723827362, 0.9999974966049194, 0.9999926090240479, 0.997235119342804, 0.8118215203285217, 0.9999916553497314, 0.9999645948410034, 0.9999630451202393, 0.5481609106063843, 0.7960696816444397, 0.9999918937683105, 0.9345138072967529, 0.3157862424850464, 0.48841118812561035, 0.593356728553772, 0.6228299140930176, 0.9991621971130371, 0.9907355904579163, 0.7343146204948425, 0.5142440795898438, 0.5024291276931763, 0.9810807108879089, 0.8736532330513, 0.6075454354286194, 0.7934282422065735, 0.949262797832489, 0.4622439444065094, 0.4610027074813843, 0.8882594108581543, 0.5364149212837219, 0.9992281198501587, 0.9941391944885254, 0.4015503227710724, 0.6402367949485779, 0.4886319041252136, 0.6199950575828552, 0.3113647699356079, 0.7857590317726135, 0.9727553129196167, 0.48555830121040344, 0.9999942779541016, 0.6127914786338806, 0.985393226146698, 0.6984302401542664], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.6000113487243652}

The negative sentiment of the text as a whole also supports this classification.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "ban", "those", "out", "dated", "practices", "'", "is", "classified", "as", "'", "negative", "'.", "The", "reason", "for", "this", "classification", "is", "that", "the", "phrase", "'", "ban", "'", "implies", "a", "restriction", "or", "prohib", "ition", ",", "which", "can", "be", "perceived", "as", "a", "negative", "action", ".", "The", "context", "of", "the", "text", "also", "suggests", "that", "the", "practices", "being", "banned", "are", "'", "out", "dated", "',", "which", "could", "be", "interpreted", "as", "in", "efficient", ",", "old", "-", "f", "ashion", "ed", ",", "or", "harmful", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", "as", "a", "whole", "also", "supports", "this", "classification", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9678873419761658, 0.8374344706535339, 0.7326557636260986, 0.9998488426208496, 0.7672573328018188, 0.9995982050895691, 0.999768078327179, 0.9999898672103882, 0.8137454390525818, 0.9999959468841553, 0.9995514750480652, 0.22592853009700775, 0.33004045486450195, 0.9998797178268433, 0.7052679657936096, 0.9742815494537354, 0.7375963926315308, 0.3782575726509094, 0.46663546562194824, 0.4235668480396271, 0.9279608130455017, 0.8839654922485352, 0.9891756176948547, 0.9250792860984802, 0.9057281017303467, 0.4161440134048462, 0.44979387521743774, 0.9876918196678162, 0.9994620680809021, 0.23234933614730835, 0.3644788861274719, 0.8677866458892822, 0.8870025277137756, 0.6876749992370605, 0.9999819993972778, 0.851952314376831, 0.6574168801307678, 0.37663885951042175, 0.6201877593994141, 0.5576434135437012, 0.9825484752655029, 0.5047609210014343, 0.8196671605110168, 0.9362481236457825, 0.4298606216907501, 0.36301836371421814, 0.32392755150794983, 0.7455542683601379, 0.9928653240203857, 0.32923758029937744, 0.6186010837554932, 0.48858168721199036, 0.8580387234687805, 0.8201763033866882, 0.45730140805244446, 0.8972985148429871, 0.48687076568603516, 0.7215363383293152, 0.625350832939148, 0.9999042749404907, 0.9999159574508667, 0.8576093316078186, 0.563535749912262, 0.3605497181415558, 0.5372075438499451, 0.613795816898346, 0.9930711388587952, 0.2826220691204071, 0.9597082138061523, 0.8102201819419861, 0.3380497097969055, 0.9773442149162292, 0.9998886585235596, 0.9998621940612793, 0.9999982118606567, 0.9697220921516418, 0.9989039897918701, 0.214622363448143, 0.7113198041915894, 0.22885149717330933, 0.27201855182647705, 0.9704838395118713, 0.25986334681510925, 0.8528603315353394, 0.4913474917411804, 0.8067622184753418, 0.9999346733093262, 0.9999996423721313, 0.5128690600395203, 0.9339258670806885, 0.8587180376052856, 0.8640753626823425, 0.6989644169807434, 0.4073856770992279], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.9742815494537354}

The phrase 'Filipino farmers aren't anti-GMO per se, they are against specific GMOs' implies that the farmers have concerns or objections towards certain GMOs, but it does not inherently convey a positive or negative sentiment towards the concept of GMOs as a whole. The word 'cause' in this context simply means 'result in' or 'lead to', and it does not carry any emotional charge.\n\nExplanation:\nThe word 'cause' in the target phrase is a verb that means 'to bring about, to give rise to, or to result in'. In the given context, it is used to describe the effect of specific GMOs on Filipino farmers. The farmers' opposition to these specific GMOs is not a reflection of their attitude towards GMOs in general. Therefore, the word 'cause' itself is neutral in polarity.\n\nThe examples provided can help illustrate this point. In example 1, the speaker is 'talking against' carbon taxes, which is a negative sentiment towards the taxes themselves.

This may seem counterintual at first, but the reason for this classification is that the phrase implies that humans have the power and ability to cause climate change, and therefore, they also have the power to stop it. The sentiment of the sentence as a whole is also positive, as it emphasizes the importance of human action to address the issue. The examples provided also demonstrate that negative phrases can have negative sentiment, while positive phrases can have positive sentiment. The polarity of a phrase should be determined based on the meaning of the words themselves, rather than the sentiment of the sentence as a whole.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "c", "aus", "ed", "climate", "change", "'", "is", "classified", "as", "'", "pos", "itive", "'.", "This", "may", "seem", "counter", "int", "ual", "at", "first", ",", "but", "the", "reason", "for", "this", "classification", "is", "that", "the", "phrase", "implies", "that", "humans", "have", "the", "power", "and", "ability", "to", "cause", "climate", "change", ",", "and", "therefore", ",", "they", "also", "have", "the", "power", "to", "stop", "it", ".", "The", "sentiment", "of", "the", "sentence", "as", "a", "whole", "is", "also", "positive", ",", "as", "it", "emphas", "izes", "the", "importance", "of", "human", "action", "to", "address", "the", "issue", ".", "The", "examples", "provided", "also", "demonstrate", "that", "negative", "phrases", "can", "have", "negative", "sentiment", ",", "while", "positive", "phrases", "can", "have", "positive", "sentiment", ".", "The", "pol", "arity", "of", "a", "phrase", "should", "be", "determined", "based", "on", "the", "meaning", "of", "the", "words", "themselves", ",", "rather", "than", "the", "sentiment", "of", "the", "sentence", "as", "a", "whole", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9658877849578857, 0.8605154156684875, 0.5439707040786743, 0.9997026324272156, 0.8705475330352783, 0.9976488947868347, 0.9999895095825195, 1.0, 0.9998514652252197, 0.9999958276748657, 0.9992086291313171, 0.49262434244155884, 0.38279756903648376, 0.9998764991760254, 0.9251411557197571, 0.9325087070465088, 0.999997615814209, 0.5765295624732971, 0.57747882604599, 0.4970923960208893, 0.9006954431533813, 0.9112599492073059, 0.9017773270606995, 0.13597078621387482, 0.4077279269695282, 0.999750554561615, 0.8168153762817383, 0.8638350367546082, 0.40210703015327454, 0.26306337118148804, 0.49384474754333496, 0.9692443013191223, 0.8604598045349121, 0.8659242391586304, 0.808175265789032, 0.8889204263687134, 0.4099898338317871, 0.48726123571395874, 0.4249018430709839, 0.9929656982421875, 0.9833395481109619, 0.9622209072113037, 0.5003565549850464, 0.5251765847206116, 0.8657674789428711, 0.999288022518158, 0.39818936586380005, 0.7322303652763367, 0.999995231628418, 0.6206622123718262, 0.44285911321640015, 0.24657021462917328, 0.40073928236961365, 0.7236409783363342, 0.8952348232269287, 0.9728286266326904, 0.9999477863311768, 0.9202750325202942, 0.8835294842720032, 0.9122223854064941, 0.9640268683433533, 0.893430769443512, 0.40031561255455017, 0.5184879302978516, 0.6413530707359314, 0.9801222681999207, 0.6393499374389648, 0.6898245811462402, 0.9995619654655457, 0.99998939037323, 0.9862807989120483, 0.4708752930164337, 0.8053653836250305, 0.8639563918113708, 0.6432375907897949, 0.9599721431732178, 0.41080936789512634, 0.998026430606842, 0.8053484559059143, 0.4828587770462036, 0.9758855700492859, 0.7097116708755493, 0.9514682292938232, 0.6862860918045044, 0.9935770630836487, 0.5410014986991882, 0.9773595929145813, 0.7008440494537354, 0.3120459318161011, 0.21796631813049316, 0.8253825306892395, 0.28640690445899963, 0.20833787322044373, 0.2826208770275116, 0.22654084861278534, 0.5323286056518555, 0.6736665368080139, 0.5571568608283997, 0.800830602645874, 0.5991925001144409, 0.8438606858253479, 0.61601322889328, 0.9984627962112427, 0.9992967844009399, 0.9618186354637146, 0.8948385715484619, 0.9977807402610779, 0.9789246320724487, 0.5249559283256531, 0.3094753623008728, 0.2801383435726166, 0.9999860525131226, 0.30413052439689636, 0.7688534259796143, 0.9852756261825562, 0.39052367210388184, 0.5865482091903687, 0.8463895916938782, 0.9330309629440308, 0.9917827844619751, 0.5740340352058411, 0.6915765404701233, 0.9699325561523438, 0.9998587369918823, 0.5979928970336914, 0.5528564453125, 0.9245554208755493, 0.5272812247276306, 0.9999977350234985, 0.9513817429542542, 0.9831210374832153, 0.948865532875061, 0.9999791383743286, 0.8646519780158997, 0.9600792527198792, 0.9999879598617554, 0.9999984502792358, 0.9951089024543762, 0.6066966652870178], "st_polarity_prediction": "positive", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.9325087070465088}

In this context, the comparison is between the energy crisis in Europe and the energy situation in the speaker's location (presumably the United States). The speaker implies that Europe is experiencing a more severe energy crisis than the United States. Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase is 'negative'.\n\nExplanation:\nThe target phrase 'far worse' is a comparative term that indicates a greater degree of negativity or adversity. In this context, the speaker is comparing the energy crisis in Europe to the energy situation in the United States and stating that Europe's crisis is 'far worse'. This implies that Europe is experiencing a more severe energy crisis than the United States. Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase is 'negative'.\n\nAdditionally, the sentiment of the text as a whole is negative, as the speaker is expressing concern about the energy crisis in Europe and implying that the United States is in a better position.

The user's tone and the use of the word 'shit' suggest a negative attitude towards the idea. The examples provided also support this classification, as they all contain negative sentiments towards various issues. In example 1, the rising costs of extreme weather are described as a weakness and an exposure of the nation's efforts. In example 2, GMOs are described as never being a solution and reinforcing corporate control. In contrast, example 3 expresses gratitude for working towards zero waste goals, and example 4 describes the livability of certain Chinese cities as a positive aspect.

In the context of the target phrase 'abandoned area are tourist attractions', the word 'abandoned' is likely used to describe the physical condition of the area, implying that it may be run down, dilapidated, or otherwise unappealing. However, the rest of the sentence suggests that despite this, the area is still a tourist attraction. This creates a somewhat paradoxical situation, where the negative sentiment of the word 'abandoned' is juxtaposed with the positive sentiment of 'tourist attractions'. Ultimately, the sentiment of the target phrase as a whole is likely to be positive, as it highlights the fact that people are still drawn to these areas despite their apparent flaws. Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase 'abandoned' should be classified as negative, but the overall sentiment of the sentence is likely to be positive.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The",

Additionally, the following phrases 'scrunching his nose in disgust' and 'smell of sex, sweat, and alcohol engulfes his senses' suggest a negative sentiment towards the abandoned area.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "word", "'", "ab", "andon", "ed", "'", "in", "the", "context", "of", "the", "provided", "text", "is", "most", "likely", "to", "have", "a", "negative", "pol", "arity", ".", "The", "reason", "for", "this", "classification", "is", "that", "the", "word", "'", "ab", "andon", "ed", "'", "often", "implies", "that", "a", "place", "is", "neg", "lected", ",", "desert", "ed", ",", "or", "for", "s", "aken", ".", "In", "the", "text", ",", "the", "area", "being", "described", "as", "abandoned", "is", "preced", "ed", "by", "the", "phrase", "'", "had", "seemed", "to", "be", "abandoned", "',", "which", "further", "emphas", "izes", "the", "sense", "of", "neglect", "and", "abandon", "ment", ".", "Additionally", ",", "the", "following", "phrases", "'", "scr", "unch", "ing", "his", "nose", "in", "disgust", "'", "and", "'", "sm", "ell", "of", "sex", ",", "sweat", ",", "and", "alcohol", "eng", "ulf", "es", "his", "senses", "'", "suggest", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "abandoned", "area", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9548760652542114, 0.7769736647605896, 0.7108474969863892, 0.9797365069389343, 0.999955415725708, 0.999906063079834, 0.9999997615814209, 0.9983048439025879, 0.24868334829807281, 0.8284096717834473, 0.29824426770210266, 0.8766389489173889, 0.9580254554748535, 0.3906145989894867, 0.8938937187194824, 0.22908145189285278, 0.352005273103714, 0.9931749701499939, 0.7686613202095032, 0.4308258891105652, 0.99339359998703, 0.9897593259811401, 0.6284504532814026, 0.9999985694885254, 0.9035159349441528, 0.46244266629219055, 0.39542707800865173, 0.3609306514263153, 0.9584836959838867, 0.6381296515464783, 0.947716474533081, 0.904548168182373, 0.7259563207626343, 0.4627628028392792, 0.8307114243507385, 0.996884286403656, 0.9999215602874756, 0.9999892711639404, 0.9990076422691345, 0.17977681756019592, 0.3281126618385315, 0.4017048180103302, 0.47696229815483093, 0.9856816530227661, 0.36520665884017944, 0.2703097462654114, 0.9999746084213257, 0.8659672737121582, 0.2174322009086609, 1.0, 0.8693780303001404, 0.8533147573471069, 0.30076348781585693, 0.9983283877372742, 0.9992823004722595, 0.6545729637145996, 0.4262246787548065, 0.7986767888069153, 0.3661336600780487, 0.9853041768074036, 0.766484797000885, 0.5407568216323853, 0.3724030554294586, 0.556158185005188, 0.4049476683139801, 0.8050282001495361, 0.19049768149852753, 0.2611757516860962, 0.9999957084655762, 0.9984334111213684, 0.5403891801834106, 0.36635300517082214, 0.9871820211410522, 0.8734356760978699, 0.9995959401130676, 0.9980847835540771, 0.999358594417572, 0.9623281955718994, 0.635443389415741, 0.6649289727210999, 0.6533517837524414, 0.6566424369812012, 0.9870310425758362, 0.7609363198280334, 0.3816814422607422, 0.9996321201324463, 0.9243475198745728, 0.7097923159599304, 0.40206265449523926, 0.9999324083328247, 0.9876711368560791, 0.35316750407218933, 0.9999908208847046, 0.9799132347106934, 0.15821294486522675, 0.4202105402946472, 0.5931702256202698, 0.3457501530647278, 0.7605800628662109, 0.7828808426856995, 0.9834365844726562, 0.9998822212219238, 0.9734712243080139, 0.9997128844261169, 0.8182862401008606, 0.9996945858001709, 0.9560641050338745, 0.5033807754516602, 0.9999569654464722, 0.9999544620513916, 0.9996461868286133, 0.8018081188201904, 0.9999887943267822, 0.753387987613678, 0.9999674558639526, 0.9999988079071045, 0.5515813231468201, 0.9915387034416199, 0.978729784488678, 0.9886539578437805, 0.9999773502349854, 0.9875892996788025, 0.3275298476219177, 0.5533748269081116, 0.5506665706634521, 0.9076005816459656, 0.9338513016700745, 0.9781060218811035, 0.7791875004768372, 0.9687991738319397, 0.9554799199104309, 0.21965906023979187], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.9897593259811401}

However, in the context of the provided text, the word 'likely' is used in conjunction with the phrase 'issues of scalability without industrial composting'. Given the negative sentiment of the phrase 'issues of scalability', it is reasonable to infer that the overall sentiment of the target phrase 'likely' is negative. This is because the likelihood of encountering 'issues of scalability' implies a challenge or obstacle that may hinder the achievement of a desired goal. In this case, the goal is to reduce the need for manure and fertilizers by using green manures and compost, but the presence of 'issues of scalability' suggests that this goal may not be easily attainable on a large scale without industrial composting.

Therefore, the target phrase 'risk' should be classified as 'negative' based on the context in which it is used.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "word", "'", "r", "isk", "'", "is", "generally", "considered", "to", "have", "a", "neutral", "sentiment", "as", "it", "simply", "implies", "a", "possibility", "of", "an", "event", "occurring", ".", "However", ",", "in", "the", "context", "of", "the", "provided", "text", ",", "the", "word", "'", "r", "isk", "'", "is", "used", "to", "describe", "a", "potential", "crisis", "related", "to", "food", "access", "and", "availability", ".", "Given", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "associated", "with", "the", "concept", "of", "a", "crisis", ",", "it", "is", "reasonable", "to", "class", "ify", "the", "target", "phrase", "as", "'", "negative", "'.", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "word", "'", "r", "isk", "'", "itself", "is", "neutral", ",", "but", "the", "context", "in", "which", "it", "is", "used", "in", "the", "text", "suggests", "a", "negative", "sentiment", ".", "The", "text", "ment", "ions", "a", "'", "food", "access", "crisis", "'", "and", "a", "'", "food", "availability", "crisis", "',", "which", "are", "both", "negative", "concepts", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "target", "phrase", "'", "r", "isk", "'", "should", "be", "classified", "as", "'", "negative", "'", "based", "on", "the", "context", "in", "which", "it", "is", "used", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9432951807975769, 0.6403703093528748, 0.5297948122024536, 0.9906837940216064, 0.9999613761901855, 1.0, 0.9982427358627319, 0.2509574592113495, 0.3527020514011383, 0.6220129728317261, 0.48913127183914185, 0.8075931072235107, 0.9835114479064941, 0.6607176065444946, 0.7652596235275269, 0.3590587079524994, 0.9996219873428345, 0.24164782464504242, 0.25970861315727234, 0.4235353171825409, 0.5553004741668701, 0.8544375896453857, 0.8648436665534973, 0.9394022226333618, 0.4078640937805176, 0.6907619833946228, 0.9597505927085876, 0.9999575614929199, 0.4770240783691406, 0.8742272257804871, 0.5097091197967529, 0.7439429759979248, 0.821005642414093, 0.5506155490875244, 0.9688780307769775, 0.9704529643058777, 0.7373051047325134, 0.3433617651462555, 0.9109650254249573, 0.9946938157081604, 0.999998927116394, 0.9999383687973022, 0.7585962414741516, 0.2801763415336609, 0.626122772693634, 0.66208815574646, 0.9679529070854187, 0.5067549347877502, 0.792022705078125, 0.3691164553165436, 0.9999943971633911, 0.9983676075935364, 0.9910658001899719, 0.9977307915687561, 0.9994643330574036, 0.6103224754333496, 0.4383535385131836, 0.8145250082015991, 0.8898033499717712, 0.8072341084480286, 0.3724885582923889, 0.9999474287033081, 0.5975342392921448, 0.2028682976961136, 0.9999663829803467, 0.99116450548172, 0.9173563122749329, 0.6173357963562012, 0.6299070715904236, 0.6528069972991943, 0.9414310455322266, 0.999995231628418, 0.7303037047386169, 0.9999903440475464, 0.9035230278968811, 0.4751318693161011, 0.999250590801239, 0.7322316765785217, 0.8143591284751892, 0.9999309778213501, 0.9044510722160339, 0.3048499524593353, 0.997875452041626, 0.7559220194816589, 0.9999330043792725, 0.9999723434448242, 0.9945371747016907, 0.8381378054618835, 0.7858995199203491, 0.6334396600723267, 0.9999858140945435, 0.9999673366546631, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9972955584526062, 0.4189619719982147, 0.44739148020744324, 0.8294983506202698, 0.4863545298576355, 0.9775102734565735, 0.5136505365371704, 0.4644288718700409, 0.8041620254516602, 0.9996414184570312, 0.9998428821563721, 0.9818259477615356, 0.9986635446548462, 0.29771140217781067, 0.986132025718689, 0.5203565955162048, 0.2782636880874634, 0.8749749660491943, 0.81584632396698, 0.7701947093009949, 0.8513885736465454, 0.893447756767273, 0.7653922438621521, 0.2606204152107239, 0.9999998807907104, 0.3600896894931793, 0.6248497366905212, 0.9979637861251831, 0.9995695948600769, 0.9996364116668701, 0.9736560583114624, 0.999824583530426, 0.9205299615859985, 0.9998289346694946, 0.9999850988388062, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9999898672103882, 0.716787576675415, 0.6112958788871765, 0.528072714805603, 0.6596888303756714, 0.8516280651092529, 0.8628815412521362, 0.9773224592208862, 0.8604888319969177, 0.9999972581863403, 0.48178035020828247, 0.7044604420661926, 0.9998157620429993, 0.9763155579566956, 0.9999942779541016, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9842183589935303, 0.3959338665008545, 0.9996588230133057, 0.9991104006767273, 0.9999978542327881, 0.970740556716919, 0.9999517202377319, 0.6401161551475525, 0.31633418798446655, 0.9999947547912598, 0.9928593635559082, 0.43724119663238525, 0.4599843919277191, 0.9998025298118591, 0.9999949932098389, 0.7403993010520935, 0.9991235136985779, 0.8794288635253906, 0.6626327037811279], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.6607176065444946}

In this context, it seems to be used to introduce a statement that explains why the low capacity factors for wind and solar are not a major concern, as long as the energy produced is cheaper than alternatives. Therefore, the polarity of this phrase is neutral.\n\nExplanation:\nThe target phrase 'so what' is a common expression used to introduce a statement that explains why something is not a major concern. In this context, it is used to introduce the idea that the low capacity factors for wind and solar are not a major issue, as long as the energy produced is cheaper than alternatives. This statement is not inherently positive or negative, as it simply acknowledges the reality of the situation.

However, the context in which it is used can influence its polarity. In the provided text, 'compliant' is used in the context of making government departments net zero compliant, which generally has a positive sentiment as it implies taking steps towards reducing carbon emissions and addressing climate change. Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase 'compliant' is 'positive'.\n\nExplanation:\nThe word 'compliant' itself does not have a positive or negative sentiment. However, the sentiment of the phrase 'make govt depts net zero compliant' is generally positive as it implies taking steps towards reducing carbon emissions and addressing climate change. The word 'compliant' in this context refers to adhering to the requirements of being net zero compliant, which is a positive action. Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase 'compliant' is 'positive'.\n\nAdditionally, the examples provided can also help in understanding the polarity of the target phrase. In example 1, the sentiment is negative as the speaker is expressing frustration and resentment towards politicians.
