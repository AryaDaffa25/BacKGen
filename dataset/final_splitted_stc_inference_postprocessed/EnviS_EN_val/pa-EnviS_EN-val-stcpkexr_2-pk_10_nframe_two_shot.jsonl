This information challenges the negative stereotype that an increase in costs is always detrimental and suggests that there may be positive outcomes associated with sustainable product design. Therefore, while the sentiment phrase itself is negative, the context of the text provides a more nuanced perspective and suggests that the sentiment subjectivity may be more complex than a simple negative or positive classification. However, given the preponderance of negative sentiment in the background knowledge and examples, and the fact that the sentiment phrase itself is negative, it is reasonable to classify the sentiment subjectivity as negative.

In this case, since the text as a whole does not express any clear positive or negative sentiment towards regulation, the sentiment subjectivity of the sentiment phrase 'regulate' is neutral.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "itself", "does", "not", "carry", "any", "inher", "ently", "positive", "or", "negative", "con", "notation", ".", "It", "simply", "means", "to", "control", "or", "manage", "something", ",", "and", "in", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", ",", "it", "refers", "to", "the", "need", "to", "reg", "ulate", "the", "quality", "and", "import", "ation", "of", "agricultural", "chemicals", ",", "which", "could", "be", "seen", "as", "a", "positive", "or", "negative", "action", "depending", "on", "one", "'", "s", "perspective", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "cannot", "be", "determined", "solely", "based", "on", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "itself", ",", "and", "additional", "context", "is", "needed", "to", "make", "an", "accurate", "classification", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "since", "the", "text", "as", "a", "whole", "does", "not", "express", "any", "clear", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "regulation", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.884888231754303, 0.745773196220398, 0.9576240181922913, 0.7569531798362732, 0.9999713897705078, 0.5636122822761536, 0.9619544148445129, 0.6269798278808594, 0.9998612999916077, 0.7999424338340759, 0.9998612999916077, 0.9999896287918091, 0.9991491436958313, 0.47897520661354065, 0.7729412913322449, 0.48721542954444885, 0.47120362520217896, 0.47951340675354004, 0.9887579083442688, 0.5557055473327637, 0.9999618530273438, 0.9999392032623291, 0.997663676738739, 0.47341683506965637, 0.6316829323768616, 0.9985644817352295, 0.3186046779155731, 0.4566749334335327, 0.4498245418071747, 0.5122182369232178, 0.9982292056083679, 0.9995962977409363, 0.9999688267707825, 0.497560054063797, 0.827459454536438, 0.45791590213775635, 0.37842389941215515, 0.31064823269844055, 0.39422211050987244, 0.8220962285995483, 0.698662519454956, 0.91920006275177, 0.51932293176651, 0.557515561580658, 0.47173067927360535, 0.7847461700439453, 0.35028767585754395, 0.8674903512001038, 0.6423221230506897, 0.9508309364318848, 0.9974368810653687, 0.7898839116096497, 0.9318091869354248, 0.9633579850196838, 0.5981181859970093, 0.9974378347396851, 0.5366408824920654, 0.5613572597503662, 0.6292588710784912, 0.9786692261695862, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9180396199226379, 0.894474983215332, 0.9953491687774658, 0.9997803568840027, 0.9999913573265076, 0.9998475313186646, 0.9999634027481079, 0.999997079372406, 0.48330631852149963, 0.820507287979126, 0.4892767667770386, 0.8820066452026367, 0.7112689018249512, 0.9996734857559204, 0.7317343354225159, 0.9347047805786133, 0.8020725250244141, 0.9930972456932068, 0.905691921710968, 0.992939829826355, 0.9998940229415894, 0.7670175433158875, 0.9999178051948547, 0.9999983906745911, 0.995743989944458, 0.9436475038528442, 0.3829275369644165, 0.9999727606773376, 0.6092162728309631, 0.9946361184120178, 0.995908260345459, 0.9999992251396179, 0.4868708848953247, 0.8684000372886658, 0.8562985062599182, 0.9998151659965515, 0.8156828284263611, 0.9999947547912598, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9997140765190125, 0.3702443242073059, 0.9998043775558472, 0.6739956140518188, 0.45590436458587646, 0.9577190279960632, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9265031814575195, 0.8987886309623718, 0.9977697134017944, 0.9855265617370605, 0.5892511010169983, 0.7755107283592224, 0.43556272983551025, 0.9955794811248779, 0.888470470905304, 0.482932448387146, 0.9976486563682556, 0.8048718571662903, 0.7960962057113647, 0.9884365797042847, 0.765289306640625, 0.9996252655982971, 0.6526045203208923, 0.819503903388977, 0.9816657900810242, 0.9999995231628418, 0.5301076769828796, 0.6674514412879944, 0.5052364468574524, 0.5301375985145569, 0.9999944567680359, 0.9999999403953552, 0.33166149258613586, 0.9999701380729675, 0.7061214447021484, 0.8449524641036987, 0.7043136358261108, 0.8466759324073792, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9999886155128479, 0.9934027194976807, 0.9167789220809937, 0.7759021520614624, 0.9725872278213501, 0.971906840801239, 0.9979128837585449, 0.9979954361915588, 0.9999995231628418, 0.6644680500030518, 0.9811899662017822, 0.9946786761283875, 0.9999022483825684, 0.997366726398468, 0.9999986290931702, 0.9999989867210388, 0.999998152256012, 0.9657248854637146, 0.9740478992462158, 0.9998018741607666, 0.9695903658866882], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.7729412913322449}

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity for the sentiment phrase 'abandoned' is negative due to its association with negative connotations.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "ab", "andon", "ed", "'", "is", "negative", ".", "The", "reason", "is", "that", "the", "word", "'", "ab", "andon", "ed", "'", "often", "implies", "a", "lack", "of", "care", ",", "attention", ",", "or", "maintenance", ",", "which", "can", "be", "associated", "with", "negative", "con", "notations", "such", "as", "neglect", ",", "decay", ",", "or", "danger", ".", "For", "example", ",", "an", "abandoned", "building", "may", "be", "seen", "as", "a", "symbol", "of", "urban", "decay", "or", "a", "potential", "haz", "ard", ",", "while", "an", "abandoned", "area", "may", "be", "perceived", "as", "a", "place", "of", "des", "olation", "or", "isolation", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "ab", "andon", "ed", "'", "is", "negative", "due", "to", "its", "association", "with", "negative", "con", "notations", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.902005672454834, 0.7919484972953796, 0.9490455389022827, 0.6165181398391724, 0.9999783039093018, 0.5889171361923218, 0.9884486794471741, 0.5929988622665405, 0.9997701644897461, 0.6838309168815613, 0.999688446521759, 0.9997566342353821, 0.999999463558197, 0.9899904727935791, 0.5269779562950134, 0.9688477516174316, 0.3889442980289459, 0.4732035994529724, 0.3814679682254791, 0.8497588634490967, 0.9817084670066833, 0.4676971435546875, 0.5617490410804749, 0.8803350329399109, 0.9999339580535889, 0.9998762011528015, 0.9998882412910461, 0.998989462852478, 0.34921813011169434, 0.32133355736732483, 0.3838730454444885, 0.8338267803192139, 0.9997857809066772, 0.8072229623794556, 0.691977322101593, 0.5306317806243896, 0.9824268817901611, 0.6299619674682617, 0.3235183656215668, 0.968697726726532, 0.6550992131233215, 0.8699955940246582, 0.3304218351840973, 0.7322019934654236, 0.9999672770500183, 0.5140222311019897, 0.4159639775753021, 0.9997591376304626, 0.874923586845398, 0.9999778866767883, 0.5029375553131104, 0.9835866093635559, 0.8065295815467834, 0.9999538064002991, 0.5403667092323303, 0.8697092533111572, 0.9671540260314941, 0.17918094992637634, 0.809599757194519, 0.9998399615287781, 0.6287866234779358, 0.9160598516464233, 0.990896999835968, 0.4355497360229492, 0.8364102840423584, 0.3297378718852997, 0.9999977350234985, 0.7641376852989197, 0.3305951952934265, 0.9996456503868103, 0.8879544734954834, 0.8135523200035095, 0.5683803558349609, 0.8477334976196289, 0.41064366698265076, 0.4979337751865387, 0.9999995231628418, 0.44160929322242737, 0.5245438814163208, 0.9252638220787048, 0.9997283816337585, 0.6868525743484497, 0.8583499193191528, 0.9419050216674805, 0.7821989059448242, 0.999956488609314, 0.2690334618091583, 0.34388041496276855, 0.5625545382499695, 0.6945786476135254, 0.9998657703399658, 0.9446237087249756, 0.2401449978351593, 0.9918991327285767, 0.3719218373298645, 0.9999916553497314, 0.9579142332077026, 0.7737072706222534, 0.8066112399101257, 0.9999877214431763, 0.7003768682479858, 0.9643669128417969, 0.8896545767784119, 0.9999061822891235, 0.999545156955719, 0.9999440312385559, 0.9999533295631409, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9999703764915466, 0.9708543419837952, 0.6960560083389282, 0.4141184687614441, 0.9996250867843628, 0.8932518362998962, 0.5449941158294678, 0.9999974966049194, 0.9448969960212708, 0.8600114583969116, 0.9999329447746277, 0.7406500577926636, 0.7278640270233154], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.9688477516174316}

The sentiment subjectivity of the sentiment phrase should be determined based on the context in which it is used and the sentiment of the text as a whole, rather than the size or magnitude of the term itself. In this case, the text as a whole does not convey any clear sentiment towards the term 'big', and therefore the sentiment subjectivity of the sentiment phrase is neutral.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "big", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "big", "'", "does", "not", "carry", "any", "inher", "ent", "positive", "or", "negative", "con", "notation", "in", "the", "given", "text", ".", "It", "is", "simply", "a", "des", "cript", "ive", "term", "used", "to", "refer", "to", "the", "size", "of", "'", "that", "thing", "'", "which", "is", "being", "discussed", "in", "the", "text", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "should", "be", "determined", "based", "on", "the", "context", "in", "which", "it", "is", "used", "and", "the", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", "as", "a", "whole", ",", "rather", "than", "the", "size", "or", "magnitude", "of", "the", "term", "itself", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "the", "text", "as", "a", "whole", "does", "not", "convey", "any", "clear", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "term", "'", "big", "',", "and", "therefore", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "is", "neutral", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8968178629875183, 0.8220334053039551, 0.898773729801178, 0.6864399313926697, 0.9994436502456665, 0.618456244468689, 0.9678289294242859, 0.7708735466003418, 0.9997282028198242, 0.8177115321159363, 0.9999181628227234, 0.9988122582435608, 0.4657125771045685, 0.925650954246521, 0.45197632908821106, 0.6681895852088928, 0.3138737678527832, 0.9899824261665344, 0.4565493166446686, 0.9999622106552124, 0.9992408752441406, 0.29296180605888367, 0.9996965527534485, 0.44510573148727417, 0.6875519752502441, 0.6952579617500305, 0.858492374420166, 0.7621959447860718, 0.9996126890182495, 0.9999809265136719, 0.5088439583778381, 0.9270883202552795, 0.3363020122051239, 0.6270291209220886, 0.6056668162345886, 0.4999673664569855, 0.37842267751693726, 0.5277784466743469, 0.4026049077510834, 0.41054317355155945, 0.6860182881355286, 0.8493514060974121, 0.9995370507240295, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9230582118034363, 0.6267186403274536, 0.967854917049408, 0.6076470613479614, 0.9999651908874512, 0.4945289194583893, 0.8323409557342529, 0.9629327654838562, 0.5560399889945984, 0.8854273557662964, 0.9998299479484558, 0.7296802401542664, 0.5638647675514221, 0.7638087868690491, 0.7153422832489014, 0.5572311878204346, 0.923114538192749, 0.9984148144721985, 0.977629542350769, 0.7796472311019897, 0.46202555298805237, 0.6315686106681824, 0.3766528069972992, 0.9999505281448364, 0.6033377051353455, 0.772455632686615, 0.4002143442630768, 0.9739230871200562, 0.2907988727092743, 0.6105061173439026, 0.7670794129371643, 0.9963909983634949, 0.999136209487915, 0.9999247193336487, 0.5177307724952698, 0.3977747857570648, 0.9991359114646912, 0.9951959252357483, 0.7421327233314514, 0.9964969754219055, 0.8517207503318787, 0.9922933578491211, 0.5663666725158691, 0.519489586353302, 0.9971191883087158, 0.4460142254829407, 0.9964251518249512, 0.9998875260353088, 0.999999463558197, 0.6979352831840515, 0.5445399284362793, 0.9999976754188538, 0.6229336261749268, 0.44573408365249634, 0.5271139740943909, 0.535699188709259, 0.8825256824493408, 0.9995019435882568, 0.5261036157608032, 0.9897937178611755, 0.9996623396873474, 0.8937922716140747, 0.8639792799949646, 0.977571964263916, 0.9999982118606567, 0.8337530493736267, 0.6841260194778442, 0.39811626076698303, 0.999986469745636, 0.9999996423721313, 0.6682424545288086, 0.9999395608901978, 0.41218116879463196, 0.7407975792884827, 0.26608747243881226, 0.509791374206543, 0.5667401552200317, 0.8206329345703125, 0.9004408121109009, 0.9996007084846497, 0.9942459464073181, 0.47453317046165466, 0.4736488461494446, 0.3543114960193634, 0.48347917199134827, 0.9999326467514038, 0.999898374080658, 0.9999986290931702, 0.4761960506439209, 0.9911051392555237, 0.8606249094009399, 0.9998564124107361, 0.34440457820892334, 0.9960182905197144, 0.999961256980896, 0.8503586053848267], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.925650954246521}

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity for the sentiment phrase 'of too much' is negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "of", "too", "much", "'", "is", "negative", ".", "The", "reason", "is", "that", "the", "phrase", "'", "too", "much", "'", "often", "implies", "an", "excess", "or", "sur", "plus", ",", "which", "can", "be", "perceived", "as", "a", "problem", "or", "a", "negative", "situation", ".", "In", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", ",", "the", "phrase", "'", "too", "much", "food", "safety", "'", "suggests", "an", "over", "ab", "und", "ance", "or", "an", "unnecessary", "emphasis", "on", "food", "safety", ",", "which", "could", "be", "seen", "as", "a", "hind", "r", "ance", "or", "a", "burden", "rather", "than", "a", "positive", "thing", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "of", "too", "much", "'", "is", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8686142563819885, 0.708737313747406, 0.9657986760139465, 0.628913938999176, 0.9999707937240601, 0.53892982006073, 0.931769073009491, 0.6420046091079712, 0.9997450113296509, 0.6805696487426758, 0.9998056888580322, 0.9999934434890747, 0.9999979138374329, 0.99966961145401, 0.8588269948959351, 0.8907853364944458, 0.5618468523025513, 0.4574716091156006, 0.3506942093372345, 0.8765197396278381, 0.9693125486373901, 0.7060473561286926, 0.6165785193443298, 0.6393990516662598, 0.63246089220047, 0.9999960660934448, 0.9992451667785645, 0.3757303059101105, 0.6335583925247192, 0.8633135557174683, 0.6779405474662781, 0.9103575944900513, 0.5450441241264343, 0.9237754344940186, 0.6775757074356079, 0.7900627255439758, 0.701019287109375, 0.5091160535812378, 0.30221202969551086, 0.9180541634559631, 0.70766681432724, 0.46713024377822876, 0.9767105579376221, 0.497424453496933, 0.5064780116081238, 0.39957788586616516, 0.3584550619125366, 0.572858989238739, 0.6061116456985474, 0.6059193015098572, 0.9349737763404846, 0.6733992099761963, 0.6576421856880188, 0.727125883102417, 0.5556869506835938, 0.48445698618888855, 0.8275194764137268, 0.5280749201774597, 0.9999962449073792, 0.995081901550293, 0.9999976754188538, 0.864861011505127, 0.36892667412757874, 0.6005913615226746, 0.3282250463962555, 0.651374101638794, 0.9999001026153564, 0.9997823238372803, 0.8646641373634338, 0.6678292155265808, 0.41489875316619873, 0.48044368624687195, 0.9996380805969238, 0.9989916086196899, 0.9999942183494568, 0.771142303943634, 0.9355211853981018, 0.44436153769493103, 0.6180925965309143, 0.812110424041748, 0.999890923500061, 0.5855770111083984, 0.5881727337837219, 0.9999976754188538, 0.9999931454658508, 0.7726414799690247, 0.663599967956543, 0.8315163850784302, 0.6290062069892883, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9998791217803955, 0.5830507278442383, 0.8043015599250793, 0.9661762714385986, 0.6448023915290833, 0.9999842643737793, 0.9787397384643555, 0.9848556518554688, 0.923663854598999, 0.9999944567680359, 0.8138682842254639, 0.9120718836784363, 0.7255146503448486, 0.9999083876609802, 0.9905804395675659, 0.9999099373817444, 0.9999974966049194, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9993256330490112, 0.9363027811050415, 0.9953656196594238, 0.9039121866226196, 0.9184645414352417], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.8907853364944458}

However, the sentiment phrase itself does not contribute to the negative sentiment in the text.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "does", "n", "'", "t", "\"", "in", "this", "context", "is", "neutral", "as", "it", "does", "not", "express", "any", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "company", "'", "s", "actions", "or", "the", "situation", "itself", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "is", "simply", "stating", "a", "fact", "that", "the", "company", "does", "not", "want", "to", "pay", "for", "the", "damages", "caused", "by", "the", "oil", "sp", "ill", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "classification", "should", "not", "be", "based", "on", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "alone", "but", "on", "the", "overall", "context", "of", "the", "text", ",", "which", "is", "negative", "due", "to", "the", "harm", "caused", "to", "the", "environment", "and", "the", "lives", "of", "the", "p", "engu", "ins", ".", "However", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "itself", "does", "not", "contribute", "to", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "in", "the", "text", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8400870561599731, 0.6325022578239441, 0.9547343254089355, 0.6267656683921814, 0.5950435996055603, 0.9981092214584351, 0.9999307990074158, 0.9990983605384827, 0.999876081943512, 0.9570473432540894, 0.5949695110321045, 0.5991110801696777, 0.9100862741470337, 0.39491212368011475, 0.22734853625297546, 0.5311903357505798, 0.98388671875, 0.6306433081626892, 0.999931275844574, 0.5429226160049438, 0.6174574494361877, 0.4262212812900543, 0.9997629523277283, 0.9999566674232483, 0.7795412540435791, 0.9872770309448242, 0.9657233357429504, 0.4151171147823334, 0.7027350664138794, 0.9999838471412659, 0.6034549474716187, 0.4198012053966522, 0.6973332762718201, 0.5615247488021851, 0.5168330073356628, 0.821182906627655, 0.6712573170661926, 0.5043910145759583, 0.526868462562561, 0.755963146686554, 0.4343412518501282, 0.4495493471622467, 0.9732213020324707, 0.9986343383789062, 0.8714447617530823, 0.9901363849639893, 0.9998669624328613, 0.7622621655464172, 0.9999751448631287, 0.9988884329795837, 0.9999987483024597, 0.997132420539856, 0.9216814041137695, 0.912177562713623, 0.739486038684845, 0.9899870157241821, 0.9553563594818115, 0.9999464750289917, 0.9999852776527405, 0.999999463558197, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9420754909515381, 0.7891348004341125, 0.8330443501472473, 0.8212804794311523, 0.9999691247940063, 0.4383261501789093, 0.30621740221977234, 0.7411553263664246, 0.9872422814369202, 0.9004823565483093, 0.9845662713050842, 0.7539649605751038, 0.9859206676483154, 0.42920681834220886, 0.9027836322784424, 0.511128842830658, 0.4467023015022278, 0.9997625946998596, 0.8524112701416016, 0.4709688723087311, 0.6115220785140991, 0.9999970197677612, 0.9784864187240601, 0.45958542823791504, 0.9495285749435425, 0.6011053323745728, 0.968354344367981, 0.3531284034252167, 0.9999964237213135, 0.9999552965164185, 0.6798129677772522, 0.9943090081214905, 0.9878749847412109, 0.9999878406524658, 0.9991310834884644, 0.9996132850646973, 0.9641989469528198, 0.17564624547958374, 0.999934732913971, 0.9046367406845093, 0.9908196926116943, 0.9999949336051941, 0.9999957084655762, 0.9831639528274536, 0.575914740562439, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9758979082107544, 0.9666994214057922, 0.9959775805473328, 0.8736570477485657, 0.5513895153999329, 0.9999852776527405, 0.3798520863056183, 0.9759272933006287, 0.9791807532310486, 0.6632588505744934, 0.9986249804496765, 0.37770047783851624, 0.7482826709747314, 0.9991173148155212, 0.5842170715332031, 0.7458471059799194], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.22734853625297546}
