This nuanced perspective is not reflected in the sentiment phrase alone, which is why the sentiment subjectivity is classified as negative based on the general sentiment stereotype of excessive cost being a negative situation.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "in", "cre", "ase", "in", "cost", "is", "often", "seen", "as", "a", "road", "block", "'", "is", "negative", ".", "This", "is", "because", "the", "excessive", "cost", "of", "goods", "and", "waste", "of", "resources", "is", "generally", "considered", "a", "negative", "situation", ".", "However", ",", "the", "text", "provides", "context", "that", "an", "increase", "in", "cost", "is", "not", "always", "a", "negative", "factor", "in", "sustainable", "product", "design", ",", "as", "some", "firms", "report", "no", "change", "in", "costs", "and", "even", "a", "decrease", "in", "costs", ".", "This", "nu", "anced", "perspective", "is", "not", "reflected", "in", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "alone", ",", "which", "is", "why", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "is", "classified", "as", "negative", "based", "on", "the", "general", "sentiment", "stere", "otype", "of", "excessive", "cost", "being", "a", "negative", "situation", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9578343629837036, 0.727614164352417, 0.948341429233551, 0.5910981893539429, 0.9999676942825317, 0.5685866475105286, 0.9719988703727722, 0.49262645840644836, 0.9969161748886108, 0.9998569488525391, 0.6514272689819336, 0.9137939214706421, 0.9999948740005493, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9999994039535522, 0.9999810457229614, 0.9997567534446716, 0.9999854564666748, 0.9999490976333618, 0.9999988079071045, 0.9999123811721802, 0.9999254941940308, 0.9999974966049194, 0.9994072914123535, 0.9826536774635315, 0.772847056388855, 0.43347492814064026, 0.4918876588344574, 0.8948259949684143, 0.9704412817955017, 0.5099236369132996, 0.48161637783050537, 0.9976964592933655, 0.8013594150543213, 0.960399329662323, 0.9650987982749939, 0.7123883366584778, 0.9997231364250183, 0.9999853372573853, 0.9240183234214783, 0.6109714508056641, 0.815546452999115, 0.9393932819366455, 0.9995369911193848, 0.9990088939666748, 0.28745511174201965, 0.8119449615478516, 0.9999938011169434, 0.6709961891174316, 0.7459917664527893, 0.447481632232666, 0.3060038387775421, 0.8691110014915466, 0.5229671001434326, 0.9947182536125183, 0.9999985694885254, 0.9353110790252686, 0.9270409345626831, 0.9999403953552246, 0.9997077584266663, 0.9307580590248108, 0.5072145462036133, 0.6614797115325928, 0.7152613997459412, 0.9356261491775513, 0.9997314810752869, 0.9999911785125732, 0.765785813331604, 0.5304691195487976, 0.5112037062644958, 0.9629058837890625, 0.6631221771240234, 0.9905521869659424, 0.9997931122779846, 0.6413882970809937, 0.9999300241470337, 0.9392802119255066, 0.5923122763633728, 0.9992583394050598, 0.998814582824707, 0.9294240474700928, 0.999963641166687, 0.5777732729911804, 0.30464139580726624, 0.43822845816612244, 0.5611223578453064, 0.8330875635147095, 0.6854162216186523, 0.9659486413002014, 0.4116964042186737, 0.9996185302734375, 0.9994514584541321, 0.7288663983345032, 0.9871636629104614, 0.32050299644470215, 0.6270074844360352, 0.5846621990203857, 0.3756757378578186, 0.961142897605896, 0.7163407206535339, 0.9922055602073669, 0.9994522929191589, 0.9999984502792358, 0.7226637005805969, 0.681041419506073, 0.9998892545700073, 0.9997082352638245, 0.5945127010345459, 0.9933351278305054, 0.9819042086601257, 0.33651918172836304, 0.9578214883804321, 0.8978783488273621, 0.9980706572532654, 0.35905560851097107, 0.3314974904060364, 0.7334685921669006, 0.8885294795036316, 0.7258807420730591, 0.9555994272232056, 0.9853750467300415, 0.9990009665489197, 0.9521870613098145], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.772847056388855}

The reason is that the absence of a sentiment phrase in this context can be seen as a reflection of the speaker's frustration and disappointment with the lack of action taken by the rich people to address the negative impact of natural disasters and global warming.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "none", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "However", ",", "given", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", ",", "which", "express", "es", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "lack", "of", "action", "taken", "by", "rich", "people", "to", "stop", "global", "war", "ming", "and", "prevent", "natural", "dis", "asters", ",", "the", "absence", "of", "a", "sentiment", "phrase", "in", "this", "context", "can", "be", "interpreted", "as", "a", "continu", "ation", "or", "intens", "ification", "of", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "in", "action", "of", "the", "rich", "people", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "none", "'", "in", "this", "context", "should", "be", "classified", "as", "negative", ".", "The", "reason", "is", "that", "the", "absence", "of", "a", "sentiment", "phrase", "in", "this", "context", "can", "be", "seen", "as", "a", "reflection", "of", "the", "speaker", "'", "s", "frustration", "and", "disappointment", "with", "the", "lack", "of", "action", "taken", "by", "the", "rich", "people", "to", "address", "the", "negative", "impact", "of", "natural", "dis", "asters", "and", "global", "war", "ming", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8863890767097473, 0.6192255616188049, 0.968562126159668, 0.6158109307289124, 0.9994946718215942, 0.7028893828392029, 0.9548736810684204, 0.7562620043754578, 0.9996216297149658, 0.8011305332183838, 0.9991913437843323, 0.998885452747345, 0.742094099521637, 0.4633139669895172, 0.42714211344718933, 0.4706241488456726, 0.9996077418327332, 0.3402179479598999, 0.9567016363143921, 0.7422534823417664, 0.8330672979354858, 0.9940405488014221, 0.9570773839950562, 0.43658873438835144, 0.40726661682128906, 0.7422698140144348, 0.9998369216918945, 0.4533434808254242, 0.9356972575187683, 0.993769109249115, 0.8649605512619019, 0.8331962823867798, 0.4242402911186218, 0.9999822378158569, 0.8428124189376831, 0.3300255239009857, 0.501960277557373, 0.5698427557945251, 0.4127219319343567, 0.7838184237480164, 0.6237438917160034, 0.9505223631858826, 0.9999799728393555, 0.9999903440475464, 0.6209934949874878, 0.48589786887168884, 0.9748653173446655, 0.9999666213989258, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9868039488792419, 0.7524828314781189, 0.529577374458313, 0.9940574169158936, 0.5419840216636658, 0.7861900925636292, 0.8878096342086792, 0.33629173040390015, 0.7323798537254333, 0.770339846611023, 0.36837679147720337, 0.9270598888397217, 0.4936935603618622, 0.9946181178092957, 0.9000371098518372, 0.31257617473602295, 0.9984627962112427, 0.54949951171875, 0.612208902835846, 0.9999065399169922, 0.9999430179595947, 0.8131153583526611, 0.9885256886482239, 0.999409556388855, 0.5721713900566101, 0.646212637424469, 0.5092438459396362, 0.9959434866905212, 0.9343653917312622, 0.6373876929283142, 0.872657060623169, 0.3369719982147217, 0.7901488542556763, 0.8312826752662659, 0.9999923706054688, 0.6022729277610779, 0.9491363763809204, 0.9923330545425415, 0.9999973773956299, 0.938443660736084, 0.9457087516784668, 0.8057761192321777, 0.9993773102760315, 0.9991999268531799, 0.9999749660491943, 0.8912221789360046, 0.6597554087638855, 0.9427833557128906, 0.9468677043914795, 0.3263082206249237, 0.9904794096946716, 0.7093867659568787, 0.999866247177124, 0.9680543541908264, 0.4657679796218872, 0.39487120509147644, 0.9217215180397034, 0.6001067757606506, 0.9851952195167542, 0.9447798728942871, 0.6417050957679749, 0.9973959922790527, 0.7398185729980469, 0.7405471801757812, 0.9964587092399597, 0.5787348747253418, 0.7741153836250305, 0.8666551113128662, 0.20165450870990753, 0.9516865611076355, 0.6367306113243103, 0.9999351501464844, 0.7024217844009399, 0.31533873081207275, 0.9463405609130859, 0.9996742010116577, 0.2628972828388214, 0.9998205304145813, 0.9999977350234985, 0.6956324577331543, 0.9599399566650391, 0.9197437167167664, 0.8092567920684814, 0.999914288520813, 0.8588107228279114, 0.9999997615814209, 0.8305385708808899, 0.7127673625946045, 0.9055684208869934, 0.5383654236793518, 0.9742457866668701, 0.9956179857254028, 0.7980962991714478, 0.9845182299613953, 0.965670645236969, 0.8489580750465393, 0.4187278747558594, 0.9993815422058105, 0.8574790954589844, 0.9999982118606567, 0.999998927116394, 0.930666983127594, 0.7122469544410706, 0.9999974966049194, 0.9999996423721313, 0.793160617351532, 0.9224805235862732], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.4633139669895172}

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity of the sentiment phrase 'cause' is neutral.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "c", "ause", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "c", "ause", "'", "itself", "does", "not", "carry", "any", "inher", "ent", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "depends", "on", "the", "context", "in", "which", "it", "is", "used", "and", "the", "sentiment", "of", "the", "overall", "text", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "c", "ause", "'", "is", "used", "to", "describe", "the", "reason", "for", "the", "farmers", "'", "opposition", "to", "specific", "G", "MO", "s", ",", "and", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", "is", "neutral", "to", "slightly", "negative", "towards", "the", "corporations", "and", "T", "NC", "s", "responsible", "for", "the", "issues", "the", "farmers", "are", "facing", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "c", "ause", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9370483756065369, 0.7984632849693298, 0.9670175909996033, 0.5431309342384338, 0.9994301199913025, 0.5763367414474487, 0.9121610522270203, 0.8498928546905518, 0.9995585083961487, 0.8260523080825806, 0.999768078327179, 0.9998176693916321, 0.9983797073364258, 0.4324875473976135, 0.6271514892578125, 0.40332910418510437, 0.7045853137969971, 0.5518911480903625, 0.9895244240760803, 0.33296263217926025, 0.9991621971130371, 0.989643931388855, 0.9998946189880371, 0.3879638910293579, 0.6844733953475952, 0.9995279312133789, 0.36574047803878784, 0.5347732901573181, 0.3899175226688385, 0.8410317301750183, 0.6771997213363647, 0.9996554851531982, 0.9999861717224121, 0.6868676543235779, 0.4820712208747864, 0.416191965341568, 0.8190784454345703, 0.35890501737594604, 0.9991564750671387, 0.7419481873512268, 0.7434390783309937, 0.6210700869560242, 0.9891614317893982, 0.6225410103797913, 0.9751968383789062, 0.9442507028579712, 0.8991519212722778, 0.5203128457069397, 0.9998372793197632, 0.9849298596382141, 0.9630842208862305, 0.9963571429252625, 0.37291809916496277, 0.9648155570030212, 0.6923324465751648, 0.44810858368873596, 0.9928763508796692, 0.2266429215669632, 0.8153275847434998, 0.892916738986969, 0.9631609320640564, 0.8060212135314941, 0.4299420714378357, 0.9999924898147583, 0.9752895832061768, 0.8213603496551514, 0.6543422341346741, 0.8203335404396057, 0.9983810186386108, 0.9640437364578247, 0.9999810457229614, 0.9702423810958862, 0.8639345169067383, 0.4807514548301697, 0.8136957287788391, 0.9418980479240417, 0.6756617426872253, 0.4275505840778351, 0.607783854007721, 0.4373752772808075, 0.9960958361625671, 0.9853128790855408, 0.9985122084617615, 0.8602080345153809, 0.9180133938789368, 0.9997888207435608, 0.999387264251709, 0.6364693641662598, 0.8061851263046265, 0.6648007035255432, 0.4904373288154602, 0.6661818623542786, 0.9882568717002869, 0.9999934434890747, 0.9997259974479675, 0.7763184905052185, 0.5809694528579712, 0.41403961181640625, 0.8237195014953613, 0.8568894267082214, 0.7019569277763367, 0.38857465982437134, 0.9195253252983093, 0.9708818197250366, 0.9998879432678223, 0.9662588238716125, 0.9999983310699463, 0.4913901686668396, 0.9999347925186157, 0.652297854423523, 0.5134017467498779, 0.358410120010376, 0.9964197874069214, 0.6086450815200806, 0.9722650051116943, 0.9756172895431519, 0.9361068606376648, 0.9999768733978271, 0.9725186228752136, 0.8953095078468323, 0.9887845516204834, 0.9999977350234985, 0.9997498393058777, 0.9428603649139404, 0.9679416418075562, 0.9999067783355713, 0.9889820218086243, 0.9999879598617554, 0.9999738931655884, 0.9999641180038452, 0.9653998017311096, 0.9785011410713196, 0.41959482431411743, 0.7190623879432678], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.6271514892578125}

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity of the sentiment phrase \"at the expense\" in this context is negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "at", "the", "expense", "\"", "implies", "a", "trade", "-", "off", "or", "a", "sacrifice", ",", "which", "can", "be", "negative", "in", "context", ",", "especially", "when", "it", "comes", "to", "social", "justice", "or", "the", "environment", ".", "For", "example", ",", "\"", "redu", "cing", "carbon", "emissions", "at", "the", "expense", "of", "worker", "'", "s", "jobs", "\"", "or", "\"", "p", "rior", "it", "izing", "economic", "growth", "at", "the", "expense", "of", "the", "environment", "\"", "are", "negative", "sentiment", "phrases", ".", "In", "the", "given", "text", ",", "the", "context", "suggests", "that", "social", "justice", "and", "the", "environment", "are", "important", "consider", "ations", "in", "making", "a", "low", "carbon", "transition", ",", "so", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "phrase", "imp", "lying", "a", "sacrifice", "or", "trade", "-", "off", "in", "these", "areas", "would", "be", "incons", "istent", "with", "the", "overall", "positive", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "at", "the", "expense", "\"", "in", "this", "context", "is", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8454686999320984, 0.6055302619934082, 0.9846532940864563, 0.6747166514396667, 0.5199545621871948, 0.999925971031189, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9999532699584961, 0.9827505350112915, 0.3854503333568573, 0.7549846768379211, 0.3618484139442444, 0.9807024598121643, 0.9999567270278931, 0.7935119867324829, 0.44489017128944397, 0.75899338722229, 0.711492121219635, 0.42107048630714417, 0.2860112190246582, 0.39464157819747925, 0.4125746786594391, 0.427104115486145, 0.4251072406768799, 0.34200185537338257, 0.5118904709815979, 0.9400193691253662, 0.514875054359436, 0.5298084020614624, 0.9998384714126587, 0.902998149394989, 0.9902550578117371, 0.6829090118408203, 0.5882457494735718, 0.9835053086280823, 0.8451213836669922, 0.390136182308197, 0.5426291823387146, 0.9997599720954895, 0.5921562910079956, 0.35838523507118225, 0.9999959468841553, 0.3147411644458771, 0.9817086458206177, 0.9963611960411072, 0.9999988079071045, 0.9999353885650635, 0.9999969005584717, 0.42047810554504395, 0.4387577474117279, 0.9999122619628906, 0.5144176483154297, 0.9847844839096069, 0.836013913154602, 0.9999711513519287, 0.5033363103866577, 0.7044064998626709, 0.9999066591262817, 0.999944806098938, 0.961683452129364, 0.9760758876800537, 0.8904896974563599, 0.9999998807907104, 0.9999593496322632, 0.9999996423721313, 0.6739308834075928, 0.990718424320221, 0.7106760144233704, 0.5859184265136719, 0.8405221700668335, 0.3519228398799896, 0.9543552398681641, 0.8216537237167358, 0.6243880987167358, 0.7299482822418213, 0.8268760442733765, 0.9178939461708069, 0.9897873401641846, 0.9089691042900085, 0.3423931300640106, 0.5961031913757324, 0.9435580968856812, 0.3643866181373596, 0.9999783039093018, 0.8300031423568726, 0.3716588318347931, 0.8269487619400024, 0.5210735201835632, 0.8623970150947571, 0.6870478391647339, 1.0, 0.4781652092933655, 0.39508116245269775, 0.2458902895450592, 0.7442473769187927, 0.5021209716796875, 0.9999104738235474, 0.5794547200202942, 0.599900484085083, 0.39922383427619934, 0.8693636655807495, 0.9973204731941223, 0.47101590037345886, 0.23309668898582458, 0.9999971389770508, 0.988105058670044, 0.529644787311554, 0.7390933036804199, 0.8733481168746948, 0.9995666146278381, 0.9999853372573853, 0.8435368537902832, 0.47611379623413086, 0.9997885823249817, 0.724827229976654, 0.744653046131134, 0.629044234752655, 0.9999984502792358, 0.9967896342277527, 0.9933724403381348, 0.7609903812408447, 0.7845464944839478, 0.5516873002052307, 0.9517501592636108, 0.9999977350234985, 0.9997348189353943, 0.9658643007278442, 0.9335463047027588, 0.9998325109481812, 0.9552046060562134, 0.9991025924682617, 0.918712317943573, 0.9999953508377075, 0.8597617149353027, 0.9519913792610168, 0.7684556841850281, 0.9999059438705444, 0.9934961795806885, 0.9999959468841553, 0.9999997615814209, 0.9998378753662109, 0.9990181922912598, 0.5914091467857361, 0.7232781052589417, 0.9379774332046509, 0.9827911257743835, 0.9248202443122864, 0.7711285352706909, 0.46903905272483826], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.4125746786594391}

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity of the phrase is neutral.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "w", "ants", "a", "bigger", "piece", "of", "this", "market", "\"", "is", "neutral", "as", "it", "does", "not", "convey", "any", "inher", "ently", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "subject", "of", "the", "market", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "phrase", "depends", "on", "the", "context", "and", "the", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", "as", "a", "whole", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "the", "text", "discuss", "es", "the", "nuclear", "energy", "market", "and", "Russia", "'", "s", "domin", "ance", "in", "it", ".", "The", "sentiment", "towards", "Russia", "'", "s", "role", "in", "the", "market", "is", "not", "explicitly", "stated", ",", "but", "the", "use", "of", "the", "word", "\"", "un", "fortunately", "\"", "at", "the", "beginning", "of", "the", "text", "may", "suggest", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "Russia", "'", "s", "position", ".", "However", ",", "South", "Korea", "'", "s", "desire", "to", "increase", "its", "presence", "in", "the", "market", "is", "not", "inher", "ently", "positive", "or", "negative", ",", "and", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "itself", "does", "not", "convey", "any", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "subject", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "phrase", "is", "neutral", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.909424901008606, 0.9060195088386536, 0.9817091822624207, 0.8868222832679749, 0.724631130695343, 0.9993973970413208, 0.9999940395355225, 0.9998695850372314, 0.9998887777328491, 0.9999339580535889, 0.997323215007782, 0.9983038902282715, 0.9999969005584717, 0.9987075328826904, 0.5528212785720825, 0.7751876711845398, 0.42887529730796814, 0.9326080679893494, 0.5302188992500305, 0.9999635219573975, 0.2926560938358307, 0.5776718258857727, 0.4416290521621704, 0.7224459052085876, 0.9969605803489685, 0.999911904335022, 0.9999614953994751, 0.8057110905647278, 0.7095866799354553, 0.9787577986717224, 0.5963717699050903, 0.2242838740348816, 0.9884423613548279, 0.3373335599899292, 0.26723915338516235, 0.6270323991775513, 0.2508954703807831, 0.6481777429580688, 0.9888237118721008, 0.43809306621551514, 0.46478620171546936, 0.5602676272392273, 0.6433404684066772, 0.9889786839485168, 0.9978564381599426, 0.8655420541763306, 0.5566961169242859, 0.6037693023681641, 0.5138387084007263, 0.649863600730896, 0.9977455735206604, 0.3506558835506439, 0.7034788131713867, 0.9997285008430481, 0.9999995231628418, 0.7136974334716797, 0.6154993176460266, 0.7877165675163269, 0.6014564037322998, 0.9999821186065674, 0.8902020454406738, 0.8480868935585022, 0.26025474071502686, 0.999987006187439, 0.6452063322067261, 0.6930564045906067, 0.9720584750175476, 0.7530534267425537, 0.8415983319282532, 0.7827147841453552, 0.87372887134552, 0.9999933242797852, 0.8690672516822815, 0.9999983310699463, 0.5640068650245667, 0.8468875885009766, 0.519716739654541, 0.6510811448097229, 0.9054853916168213, 0.5978630781173706, 0.4230533242225647, 0.6711397171020508, 0.9999921321868896, 0.4426594376564026, 0.545749306678772, 0.8260533213615417, 0.9391478896141052, 0.9585237503051758, 0.7034656405448914, 0.8708001971244812, 0.9871892333030701, 0.48267990350723267, 0.6425777077674866, 0.6688856482505798, 0.7193634510040283, 0.9999997615814209, 0.8921977281570435, 0.9419173002243042, 0.8382554054260254, 0.9993410706520081, 0.9962395429611206, 0.9999363422393799, 0.5239540338516235, 0.9999994039535522, 0.996810257434845, 0.9117462635040283, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9996028542518616, 0.36996304988861084, 0.690740704536438, 0.9511929750442505, 0.9989365935325623, 0.9692923426628113, 0.8195105791091919, 0.9815136790275574, 0.847287654876709, 0.9999954700469971, 0.2476760298013687, 0.5933115482330322, 0.9734322428703308, 0.9999992847442627, 0.5249518752098083, 0.9996325969696045, 0.9997674822807312, 0.9999967813491821, 0.9573529362678528, 0.558941662311554, 0.43517887592315674, 0.9998723268508911, 0.41742977499961853, 0.9999984502792358, 0.9786842465400696, 0.9806333184242249, 0.7550378441810608, 0.8162149786949158, 0.911891758441925, 0.999997615814209, 0.7721781134605408, 0.9999825954437256, 0.9999810457229614, 0.5182669758796692, 0.691910445690155, 0.9507338404655457, 0.6988970041275024, 0.8260684013366699, 0.4884447753429413, 0.9306342005729675, 0.9999932050704956, 0.8362131118774414, 0.9824045300483704, 0.8076974749565125, 0.9635059237480164, 0.8989966511726379, 0.7483530640602112, 0.6541886925697327, 0.8459910750389099, 0.9999992847442627, 0.8336852192878723, 0.999496340751648, 0.999369204044342, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9745069146156311, 0.9290152192115784, 0.8503069281578064, 0.6765980124473572, 0.9981624484062195, 0.9917569756507874, 0.8878020644187927], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.7751876711845398}
