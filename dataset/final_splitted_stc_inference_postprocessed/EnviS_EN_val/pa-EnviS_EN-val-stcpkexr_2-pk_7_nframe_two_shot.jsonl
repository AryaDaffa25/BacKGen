However, the sentiment phrase 'regulate' itself does not convey this positive sentiment and is therefore neutral.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "itself", "does", "not", "carry", "any", "positive", "or", "negative", "con", "notation", ".", "It", "is", "a", "call", "to", "action", "to", "implement", "rules", "or", "standards", ",", "which", "can", "be", "perceived", "as", "positive", "or", "negative", "depending", "on", "the", "context", ".", "In", "this", "text", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "is", "used", "in", "the", "context", "of", "reg", "ulating", "the", "quality", "and", "import", "ation", "of", "agricultural", "chemicals", ",", "implementing", "a", "national", "organic", "food", "policy", ",", "and", "en", "for", "cing", "section", "", "1", "8", "of", "the", "agriculture", "chemicals", "control", "act", "", "2", "0", "0", "7", ".", "These", "actions", "can", "be", "perceived", "as", "positive", "as", "they", "aim", "to", "ensure", "the", "safety", "and", "quality", "of", "agricultural", "products", "and", "protect", "the", "environment", ".", "However", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "itself", "does", "not", "convey", "this", "positive", "sentiment", "and", "is", "therefore", "neutral", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8738473653793335, 0.7581343650817871, 0.9644479751586914, 0.7151191830635071, 0.999966025352478, 0.5846167206764221, 0.9657260775566101, 0.6177123188972473, 0.9998730421066284, 0.7789387702941895, 0.9999092221260071, 0.999991774559021, 0.9993225932121277, 0.47982126474380493, 0.818945586681366, 0.530052900314331, 0.4600141942501068, 0.47231325507164, 0.986744225025177, 0.5200754404067993, 0.9999699592590332, 0.999914288520813, 0.9981931447982788, 0.49691763520240784, 0.6328397989273071, 0.9986010789871216, 0.31154072284698486, 0.456083744764328, 0.4710220396518707, 0.9991283416748047, 0.9999324679374695, 0.4529116451740265, 0.9082051515579224, 0.2878093719482422, 0.3785902261734009, 0.38042864203453064, 0.5880207419395447, 0.2930997610092163, 0.6306222677230835, 0.9947242140769958, 0.1987992823123932, 0.2676105499267578, 0.28674784302711487, 0.5510078072547913, 0.16564011573791504, 0.4204425513744354, 0.5211388468742371, 0.7713909149169922, 0.811833381652832, 0.3636183440685272, 0.9195733666419983, 0.91434246301651, 0.7767240405082703, 0.9999553561210632, 0.99430912733078, 0.999203622341156, 0.9967259168624878, 0.8940730690956116, 0.8984976410865784, 0.691788375377655, 0.576090931892395, 0.7241730093955994, 0.9982628226280212, 0.7086714506149292, 0.3914780616760254, 0.3274815082550049, 0.8918862342834473, 0.9992058277130127, 0.9998843669891357, 0.9998691082000732, 0.9512962102890015, 0.4745001792907715, 0.8984324336051941, 0.5045359134674072, 0.9962116479873657, 0.9999765157699585, 0.6035205125808716, 0.9999979138374329, 0.8833864331245422, 0.9744532108306885, 0.9938324093818665, 0.9992347955703735, 0.9999887943267822, 0.9999855756759644, 0.9999422430992126, 0.9999962449073792, 0.7065224647521973, 0.447750985622406, 0.4675917327404022, 0.9998864531517029, 0.9999892115592957, 0.9999962449073792, 0.9999955296516418, 0.9891158938407898, 0.9999909996986389, 0.5265048146247864, 0.998445451259613, 0.9999990463256836, 0.533936083316803, 0.9999653100967407, 0.9999973177909851, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9999961853027344, 0.9610422849655151, 0.9999547004699707, 0.9999908208847046, 0.999975323677063, 0.9377737045288086, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9999989867210388, 0.999999463558197, 0.9999983906745911, 0.7873204946517944, 0.506197988986969, 0.9495181441307068, 0.48968443274497986, 0.9933546781539917, 0.6406264901161194, 0.9485602974891663, 0.8902478218078613, 0.5391039848327637, 0.9999411702156067, 0.9046539068222046, 0.9999366402626038, 0.37254250049591064, 0.9001237750053406, 0.9949260354042053, 0.9931269884109497, 0.734940230846405, 0.9999962449073792, 0.9597676396369934, 0.8628436326980591, 0.65281742811203, 0.9533291459083557, 0.9180427193641663, 0.9913762807846069, 0.8888461589813232, 0.9029805064201355, 0.9999997019767761, 0.6111372113227844, 0.9379221200942993, 0.9486156105995178, 0.872786283493042, 0.9999755024909973, 0.9999942183494568, 0.999997079372406, 0.7502298355102539, 0.9040623307228088, 0.9999966025352478, 0.5222981572151184, 0.7587217688560486, 0.9790849089622498, 0.5873191952705383, 0.46812334656715393, 0.531754195690155, 0.545055091381073, 0.9585990905761719, 0.9401784539222717, 0.9089651703834534], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.818945586681366}

Overall, the sentiment phrase 'never' conveys a negative sentiment towards the idea of neglecting public improvements and the negative impact it has on the community.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "never", "'", "in", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", "express", "es", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "idea", "or", "policy", "of", "public", "improvements", "being", "neg", "lected", "in", "favor", "of", "tax", "cuts", "for", "the", "wealthy", ".", "The", "neg", "ation", "of", "the", "assumption", "that", "public", "improvements", "are", "a", "priority", "reflects", "a", "general", "sentiment", "of", "disappointment", "and", "opposition", "towards", "this", "situation", ".", "The", "text", "also", "provides", "examples", "of", "clean", "and", "updated", "public", "rest", "rooms", "in", "M", "N", ",", "which", "contrast", "s", "sharply", "with", "the", "dirty", "and", "rund", "own", "rest", "rooms", "in", "N", "W", "I", "A", ",", "further", "emphas", "izing", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "lack", "of", "public", "improvements", "in", "the", "region", ".", "Overall", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "never", "'", "conve", "ys", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "idea", "of", "neglect", "ing", "public", "improvements", "and", "the", "negative", "impact", "it", "has", "on", "the", "community", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8958607316017151, 0.6937944293022156, 0.7352989315986633, 0.6041731834411621, 0.6285387873649597, 0.9981390237808228, 0.997826099395752, 0.4756277799606323, 0.5214784145355225, 0.5084008574485779, 0.9473405480384827, 0.7694411873817444, 0.6502817869186401, 0.4600546360015869, 0.9996708631515503, 0.8349612951278687, 0.6570159792900085, 0.9888370037078857, 0.834688127040863, 0.8720385432243347, 0.25541430711746216, 0.48157310485839844, 0.27127474546432495, 0.7288073897361755, 0.37655726075172424, 0.9882078170776367, 0.8496178984642029, 0.7339012026786804, 0.993268609046936, 0.6845486760139465, 0.9971677660942078, 0.9998878240585327, 0.9965593218803406, 0.9999725818634033, 0.992478609085083, 0.97601318359375, 0.9999017715454102, 0.8619974255561829, 0.5057343244552612, 0.83637934923172, 0.9987658858299255, 0.4458502233028412, 0.548443615436554, 0.28011801838874817, 0.9576120376586914, 0.8732740879058838, 0.9903573989868164, 0.9752259850502014, 0.3756066858768463, 0.9970110654830933, 0.3829799294471741, 0.6257070899009705, 0.4815545976161957, 0.9611456990242004, 0.9999579191207886, 0.9296244978904724, 0.8881516456604004, 0.6947659254074097, 0.9456393122673035, 0.5483682751655579, 0.6632735729217529, 0.7543277144432068, 0.3457779884338379, 0.2097240835428238, 0.21223127841949463, 0.3417903482913971, 0.48404762148857117, 0.9962402582168579, 0.3660965859889984, 0.8842126131057739, 0.9891811609268188, 0.7738561034202576, 0.4117898643016815, 0.9976695775985718, 0.9847152829170227, 0.8668519854545593, 0.997894823551178, 0.7624514698982239, 0.5522875189781189, 0.3054203391075134, 0.9599980115890503, 0.5524260401725769, 0.9999803900718689, 0.9993694424629211, 0.9576365947723389, 0.9997625350952148, 0.996886670589447, 0.9999996423721313, 0.3348758816719055, 0.9993807673454285, 0.9618768692016602, 0.9932569861412048, 0.9999657273292542, 0.9566074013710022, 0.9999713897705078, 0.8628153800964355, 0.746504008769989, 0.8027159571647644, 0.9998669028282166, 0.9911354184150696, 0.9716395735740662, 0.9924785494804382, 0.9909964799880981, 0.9819697737693787, 0.8372505307197571, 0.9999935626983643, 0.7495297789573669, 0.9684604406356812, 0.5997582077980042, 0.575005829334259, 0.3584217429161072, 0.9798471331596375, 0.30181753635406494, 0.9999818205833435, 0.994762122631073, 0.6962920427322388, 0.898212730884552, 0.9187455773353577, 0.9999303817749023, 0.9948583841323853, 0.33451682329177856, 0.9999938607215881, 0.9997417330741882, 0.8804588317871094, 0.9936330318450928, 0.9161758422851562, 0.9605633616447449, 0.22294458746910095, 0.592226505279541, 0.3719552159309387, 0.9999403357505798, 0.9999276995658875, 0.998183012008667, 0.6610849499702454, 0.42279723286628723, 0.6866750121116638, 0.965607225894928, 0.9828967452049255, 0.6949066519737244, 0.9999752044677734, 0.7536254525184631, 0.940211296081543, 0.8122611045837402, 0.972791314125061], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.6570159792900085}

The delay in creating affordable housing in liberal cities is a clear example of unsociable behavior.

From investing in soil health to reducing waste, and from promoting efficient use of resources to focusing on renewable energy, there are numerous initiatives that are making a positive impact. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security.

This negative perception is further reinforced by the overall context of the text, which highlights the challenges and negative consequences of certain policies and decisions.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "b", "anned", "it", "'", "is", "negative", ".", "The", "reason", "is", "that", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "implies", "a", "restriction", "or", "prohib", "ition", ",", "which", "can", "be", "perceived", "as", "limiting", "or", "unf", "avor", "able", ",", "especially", "when", "it", "comes", "to", "energy", "production", "and", "policies", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "suggests", "that", "Europe", "has", "taken", "actions", "that", "limit", "the", "use", "of", "certain", "energy", "sources", ",", "such", "as", "fr", "acking", ",", "which", "can", "be", "seen", "as", "det", "r", "imental", "to", "energy", "security", "and", "availability", ".", "This", "negative", "perception", "is", "further", "rein", "forced", "by", "the", "overall", "context", "of", "the", "text", ",", "which", "highlights", "the", "challenges", "and", "negative", "consequences", "of", "certain", "policies", "and", "decisions", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8691329956054688, 0.6300565004348755, 0.977322518825531, 0.5767442584037781, 0.9999818205833435, 0.6351262331008911, 0.9873458743095398, 0.7068300247192383, 0.9998766779899597, 0.5947700142860413, 0.9992315173149109, 0.9999901056289673, 0.9999540448188782, 0.9954825639724731, 0.730579674243927, 0.9548584818840027, 0.34594663977622986, 0.47786185145378113, 0.8131020665168762, 0.7718963027000427, 0.958913266658783, 0.8088651299476624, 0.3746447265148163, 0.9880059361457825, 0.413606733083725, 0.6615825295448303, 0.860553503036499, 0.8702359199523926, 0.38588613271713257, 0.9999857544898987, 0.493512362241745, 0.8523626923561096, 0.6093149781227112, 0.7572097778320312, 0.7186973094940186, 0.9717066287994385, 0.517708957195282, 0.9285829067230225, 0.4468860924243927, 0.9980078935623169, 0.9999983310699463, 0.6449843049049377, 0.4756790101528168, 0.7794562578201294, 0.8159163594245911, 0.9633338451385498, 0.9999983310699463, 0.7862441539764404, 0.7301096320152283, 0.7813680171966553, 0.7274609804153442, 0.5853809118270874, 0.3232552111148834, 0.6586835384368896, 0.8163250684738159, 0.9997236132621765, 0.9260604977607727, 0.4001082479953766, 0.9127148985862732, 0.4353828728199005, 0.8088428378105164, 0.4153250455856323, 0.9623172283172607, 0.47197437286376953, 0.3869956135749817, 0.550608217716217, 0.43588224053382874, 0.554945707321167, 0.4824978709220886, 0.783854067325592, 0.5427658557891846, 0.9822502136230469, 0.9797422885894775, 0.9637404084205627, 0.7438588738441467, 0.999991774559021, 0.9986676573753357, 0.999997079372406, 0.9897101521492004, 0.8959512710571289, 0.501197874546051, 0.6305149793624878, 0.805984377861023, 0.9956440925598145, 0.5649549961090088, 0.9999783635139465, 0.9999977350234985, 0.9508712887763977, 0.6022896766662598, 0.9280316829681396, 0.998350977897644, 0.21452000737190247, 0.7898619771003723, 0.2804681062698364, 0.7728018760681152, 0.40145382285118103, 0.9499671459197998, 0.4467218220233917, 0.784079909324646, 0.9997604489326477, 0.9466874599456787, 0.9996085166931152, 0.6533332467079163, 0.6175458431243896, 0.9978092908859253, 0.999691367149353, 0.9986152052879333, 0.9716017842292786, 0.9987456202507019, 0.4441866874694824, 0.580722987651825, 0.47506970167160034, 0.6879382729530334, 0.53928142786026, 0.9245035648345947, 0.987357497215271, 0.46740666031837463, 0.49465352296829224, 0.8073968887329102, 0.5334141850471497, 0.7152475714683533, 0.81475430727005], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.9548584818840027}

However, the sentiment phrase \"actions are being taken\" itself is neutral and does not convey any sentiment towards the subjectivity of the actions being taken. It could be referring to positive actions being taken or negative actions being taken, and without further context, it is impossible to determine the sentiment subjectivity of the phrase.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "actions", "are", "being", "taken", "\"", "is", "neutral", "as", "it", "does", "not", "convey", "a", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "subject", "of", "the", "sentence", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "phrase", "depends", "on", "the", "context", "in", "which", "it", "is", "used", "and", "the", "intent", "behind", "the", "actions", "being", "taken", ".", "In", "the", "given", "text", ",", "the", "sentiment", "is", "negative", "towards", "the", "government", "for", "not", "taking", "sufficient", "actions", "regarding", "the", "G", "SL", ",", "d", "rought", ",", "and", "poor", "air", "quality", ".", "However", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "actions", "are", "being", "taken", "\"", "itself", "is", "neutral", "and", "does", "not", "convey", "any", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "actions", "being", "taken", ".", "It", "could", "be", "referring", "to", "positive", "actions", "being", "taken", "or", "negative", "actions", "being", "taken", ",", "and", "without", "further", "context", ",", "it", "is", "impossible", "to", "determine", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "phrase", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9501984119415283, 0.8033539056777954, 0.9796258211135864, 0.5538616180419922, 0.6396484971046448, 0.9999609589576721, 0.9999781250953674, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9999907612800598, 0.9998130202293396, 0.6492796540260315, 0.32422199845314026, 0.38770145177841187, 0.9111464619636536, 0.6822494864463806, 0.9999140501022339, 0.3915683925151825, 0.48342999815940857, 0.7507370710372925, 0.9971104264259338, 0.9995946884155273, 0.65623939037323, 0.7388231158256531, 0.9400460720062256, 0.48416566848754883, 0.4144926071166992, 0.9987009763717651, 0.31412214040756226, 0.6959313750267029, 0.7621526718139648, 0.2641729712486267, 0.5642911791801453, 0.9846354126930237, 0.4546855688095093, 0.49301275610923767, 0.5972639918327332, 0.682197093963623, 0.9850262999534607, 0.9991089701652527, 0.9151086807250977, 0.4889414608478546, 0.9999947547912598, 0.9993524551391602, 0.9749482274055481, 0.9875468015670776, 0.5035741925239563, 0.9666066765785217, 0.23167766630649567, 0.5783976912498474, 0.8920102715492249, 0.9608820080757141, 0.9354087710380554, 0.9623059630393982, 0.989812433719635, 0.5478192567825317, 0.571809709072113, 0.7900672554969788, 0.8727855086326599, 0.9922657608985901, 0.9426684379577637, 0.717661440372467, 0.3954470157623291, 0.7980964779853821, 0.5266020894050598, 0.9910575151443481, 0.31103795766830444, 0.36818698048591614, 0.7474054098129272, 0.9158633947372437, 0.3375799357891083, 0.7395423650741577, 0.5013376474380493, 0.9004250764846802, 0.6936211585998535, 0.9998871088027954, 0.9744265675544739, 0.5757702589035034, 0.9999974966049194, 0.9999131560325623, 0.9999982118606567, 0.8290956020355225, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9999599456787109, 0.8942590355873108, 0.9133104085922241, 0.9999968409538269, 0.9969052672386169, 0.8527515530586243, 0.9988625645637512, 0.5702518224716187, 0.9999909400939941, 0.9996396899223328, 0.9999978542327881, 0.9999943971633911, 0.9999653697013855, 0.6841551065444946, 0.5994555354118347, 0.7962247133255005, 0.4903416931629181, 0.8911873698234558, 0.9999855756759644, 0.4906391203403473, 0.594278872013092, 0.7638794183731079, 0.9061614274978638, 0.9754118323326111, 0.707067608833313, 0.7085974216461182, 0.9343146681785583, 0.9922528862953186, 0.8864267468452454, 0.9485272765159607, 0.9989259243011475, 0.8816766142845154, 0.43740856647491455, 0.2884686589241028, 0.5163499116897583, 0.3307289779186249, 0.9999977350234985, 0.5719221234321594, 0.6444026231765747, 0.9054244756698608, 0.9999874830245972, 0.6582285761833191, 0.9991848468780518, 0.9898184537887573, 0.9887053370475769, 0.9999456405639648, 0.89982008934021, 0.3488090932369232, 0.9814841747283936, 0.49973705410957336, 0.9861825704574585, 0.9739636182785034, 0.9976406097412109, 0.9215399622917175, 0.9722041487693787, 0.9999969005584717, 0.9966723918914795, 0.9843417406082153, 0.9992802739143372, 0.998842716217041, 0.9999986290931702, 0.9943587183952332, 0.9914917349815369, 0.5402312278747559, 0.41685616970062256, 0.4829834997653961], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.32422199845314026}

From investing in soil health to reducing waste, and from promoting efficient use of resources to focusing on renewable energy, there are numerous initiatives that are making a positive impact. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security.

However, without additional context, it is impossible to determine the sentiment subjectivity of the phrase with certainty.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "com", "pl", "iant", "\"", "is", "neutral", "as", "it", "does", "not", "convey", "any", "positive", "or", "negative", "emotion", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "phrase", "depends", "on", "the", "context", "in", "which", "it", "is", "used", ".", "In", "the", "given", "text", ",", "the", "phrase", "\"", "make", "go", "vt", "de", "pts", "net", "zero", "compl", "iant", "\"", "suggests", "that", "the", "government", "departments", "are", "being", "asked", "to", "comply", "with", "a", "net", "zero", "carbon", "emissions", "target", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "phrase", "\"", "com", "pl", "iant", "\"", "is", "positive", "as", "it", "implies", "that", "the", "government", "departments", "are", "taking", "steps", "towards", "reducing", "their", "carbon", "emissions", "and", "contributing", "to", "a", "more", "sustainable", "future", ".", "However", ",", "without", "additional", "context", ",", "it", "is", "impossible", "to", "determine", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "phrase", "with", "certain", "ty", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9107707142829895, 0.7677009105682373, 0.9650242924690247, 0.5832839608192444, 0.5347139239311218, 0.9999822974205017, 0.9999088644981384, 0.9999529719352722, 0.9951146245002747, 0.6147211194038391, 0.5083710551261902, 0.5060171484947205, 0.9956850409507751, 0.6454027891159058, 0.9993302822113037, 0.33670538663864136, 0.4939427673816681, 0.6899637579917908, 0.9996379017829895, 0.9999169111251831, 0.8523633480072021, 0.2796066701412201, 0.4104749858379364, 0.3789564073085785, 0.8058616518974304, 0.9892516732215881, 0.5279850363731384, 0.486843466758728, 0.3517327904701233, 0.34717851877212524, 0.9933759570121765, 0.9986227750778198, 0.9671509861946106, 0.8403024673461914, 0.9999939799308777, 0.9987189173698425, 0.9783352017402649, 0.9945127964019775, 0.7866032719612122, 0.5568192005157471, 0.7256798148155212, 0.7571864128112793, 0.9250381588935852, 0.9803852438926697, 0.5856282114982605, 0.448270320892334, 0.7754354476928711, 0.36615920066833496, 0.9991952776908875, 0.9983623027801514, 0.9998188614845276, 0.9979874491691589, 0.9998194575309753, 0.9994636178016663, 0.9996498823165894, 0.9999775290489197, 0.9985440969467163, 0.4506623148918152, 0.7919766902923584, 0.8825406432151794, 0.9330982565879822, 0.9739786982536316, 0.8847432732582092, 0.46042051911354065, 0.6548601388931274, 0.6690943837165833, 0.5878554582595825, 0.9999838471412659, 0.5593293905258179, 0.31517648696899414, 0.6930502653121948, 0.26555880904197693, 0.513420820236206, 0.3945968449115753, 0.7319127917289734, 0.5515393018722534, 0.8649279475212097, 0.9926416277885437, 0.9999718070030212, 0.5397400259971619, 0.7629719972610474, 0.8031782507896423, 0.9999856948852539, 0.9879651665687561, 0.9523636698722839, 0.5914703607559204, 0.9767704010009766, 0.999995768070221, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9998996257781982, 0.9998840093612671, 0.4744046628475189, 0.6164867877960205, 0.635187566280365, 0.9912716746330261, 0.6437442302703857, 0.9656621217727661, 0.9814249873161316, 0.9918964505195618, 0.9918575882911682, 0.9993569254875183, 0.9907187819480896, 0.8169944882392883, 0.5227133631706238, 0.9442232847213745, 0.9907885789871216, 0.999763548374176, 0.6527989506721497, 0.8933514356613159, 0.985666036605835, 0.9872785806655884, 0.9822388291358948, 0.9853270053863525, 0.9997156262397766, 0.9721986055374146, 0.9901902079582214, 0.47577640414237976, 0.9999973177909851, 0.6449648141860962, 0.4930860996246338, 0.9545304179191589, 0.8739608526229858, 0.862115204334259, 0.9887517094612122, 0.7721843123435974, 0.9999638199806213, 0.5297351479530334, 0.9816368222236633, 0.9957243204116821, 0.9710356593132019, 0.9999973773956299, 0.975975751876831, 0.9962671995162964, 0.9954786896705627, 0.7648728489875793, 0.4922392964363098, 0.9999989867210388, 0.8708584308624268, 0.44221562147140503], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.5083710551261902}

From investing in soil health to reducing waste, and from promoting efficient use of resources to focusing on renewable energy, there are numerous initiatives that are making a positive impact. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research, while significant, can be countered by strong policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6. Similarly, funding active travel schemes instead of giant road projects can lead to energy security, health, and net zero emissions. The importance of these steps cannot be overstated, as they not only contribute to a healthier society but also help reduce the risk of harmful situations. For example, renewable energy, which is safer and far more efficient than fossil fuels, is becoming increasingly essential for the energy transition and energy security. Moreover, focusing on reusables and recycling, instead of just paying to dump rubbish, is a more sustainable and necessary approach to waste management.

The loss of choice in food and energy, the destruction of democracy, and the prioritization of profits over people's well-being are all contributing to a worrying trend. It seems that we are moving backwards instead of forwards, and the future looks uncertain and bleak.", "The constant threat of death from various sources, including pollution, nuclear war, and unhealthy practices, is a major concern and a negative aspect of our current state of affairs. The fact that some individuals and corporations continue to prioritize their own interests over the health and well-being of others and the environment is a major cause of this negative situation. The lies and deceit that are often used to justify these harmful practices only add to the problem.", "From the input texts, it's clear that many individuals and organizations are taking steps to make a positive impact on the environment and the world around them. Whether it's through reducing plastic pollution, developing sustainable agriculture, or creating more sustainable technologies, the commitment to making a difference is evident. For instance, reusing ten single-use plastics can halve plastic pollution in the ocean, and more sustainable and health tourism can be found in all countries. Some individuals are even going as far as buying up properties and contributing to sustainable agriculture and irrigation development in third world countries. Cultivated meat, which is the same meat we've always known and loved, is being crafted with care in a cultivator using plant protein to provide meat that is better for you and better for the planet. The unique network, built on a proof of stake network with a low carbon footprint, takes care of the environment. These are just a few examples of the many ways people are making a difference. It's inspiring to see the dedication and effort being put forth to create a better future for all.", "It's heartening to see that in the early 70s, more than 68% of Bengaluru was covered in vegetation.
