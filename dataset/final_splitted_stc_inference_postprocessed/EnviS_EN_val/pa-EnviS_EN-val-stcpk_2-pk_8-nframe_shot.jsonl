Therefore, the safest and most accurate classification is 'neutral'.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "is", "'", "neut", "ral", "'.", "While", "the", "word", "'", "reg", "ulate", "'", "itself", "is", "neutral", ",", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", "suggests", "a", "need", "for", "control", "and", "overs", "ight", ",", "which", "can", "be", "perceived", "as", "positive", "or", "negative", "depending", "on", "the", "specific", "issue", "and", "the", "perspective", "of", "the", "individual", ".", "However", ",", "without", "further", "context", "or", "information", "about", "the", "specific", "environmental", "issue", "being", "addressed", "in", "the", "text", ",", "it", "is", "not", "possible", "to", "definit", "ively", "class", "ify", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "as", "positive", "or", "negative", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "saf", "est", "and", "most", "accurate", "classification", "is", "'", "neut", "ral", "'.", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.885921061038971, 0.7790114879608154, 0.8847519159317017, 0.9088483452796936, 0.999988317489624, 0.7041480541229248, 0.9616416692733765, 0.5991325974464417, 0.9963717460632324, 0.9998284578323364, 0.8262072801589966, 0.9997540712356567, 0.9999912977218628, 0.9993425011634827, 0.8954671025276184, 0.7852988839149475, 0.9373610019683838, 0.9999916553497314, 0.4665176272392273, 0.3190191090106964, 0.8220475316047668, 0.4572700262069702, 0.9632099866867065, 0.9999781847000122, 0.9995002746582031, 0.999966025352478, 0.7251033186912537, 0.630976676940918, 0.40383562445640564, 0.9165481328964233, 0.8201860785484314, 0.48047804832458496, 0.6341395974159241, 0.9847567677497864, 0.7883012294769287, 0.3436276912689209, 0.5240253806114197, 0.7021232843399048, 0.9494695067405701, 0.24379177391529083, 0.8852275609970093, 0.9587845802307129, 0.999993622303009, 0.7252532243728638, 0.9903331398963928, 0.6287595629692078, 0.8578771352767944, 0.5895321369171143, 0.9633898735046387, 0.6841205954551697, 0.6660884618759155, 0.9999387860298157, 0.9970681071281433, 0.9999382495880127, 0.5431972146034241, 0.8188140392303467, 0.5662510991096497, 0.33518722653388977, 0.3860167860984802, 0.4215557873249054, 0.9997652769088745, 0.9997308254241943, 0.36845239996910095, 0.9925619959831238, 0.542259693145752, 0.9999996423721313, 0.37153160572052, 0.4280368387699127, 0.5096871256828308, 0.3531266450881958, 0.5835892558097839, 0.8732592463493347, 0.9952548742294312, 0.9391089677810669, 0.30177050828933716, 0.7628107070922852, 0.8535581827163696, 0.661933958530426, 0.7642353773117065, 0.9991058111190796, 0.9993957281112671, 0.9630433320999146, 0.9925345778465271, 0.983132004737854, 0.7709385752677917, 0.9963501691818237, 0.9999805092811584, 0.8182279467582703, 0.9999976754188538, 0.9481453895568848, 0.9999939799308777, 0.9997625350952148, 0.9999469518661499, 0.9806780815124512, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9903508424758911, 0.9780654311180115, 0.9999744296073914, 0.9999818205833435, 0.8910587430000305, 0.6537395119667053, 0.9999036192893982, 0.6864015460014343, 0.29397666454315186, 0.9999996423721313, 0.5716104507446289, 0.9982044696807861, 0.9582158327102661, 0.8923014402389526, 0.45255351066589355, 0.9939579367637634, 0.9999627470970154, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9862309098243713, 0.8522230386734009], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.9373610019683838}

Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity for the sentiment phrase 'complain' is neutral.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "com", "plain", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "itself", "does", "not", "carry", "any", "positive", "or", "negative", "con", "notation", ",", "as", "complaining", "can", "be", "seen", "as", "a", "way", "to", "express", "diss", "atisf", "action", "or", "voice", "concerns", ",", "which", "can", "be", "both", "positive", "or", "negative", "depending", "on", "the", "context", ".", "In", "this", "case", ",", "the", "context", "provided", "does", "not", "give", "enough", "information", "to", "determine", "if", "the", "complaining", "is", "positive", "or", "negative", ",", "as", "it", "only", "ment", "ions", "that", "the", "customer", "is", "complaining", "about", "a", "strange", "customer", "service", "policy", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "com", "plain", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9110395908355713, 0.726367175579071, 0.9378794431686401, 0.9107158780097961, 0.999989926815033, 0.6854853630065918, 0.959610104560852, 0.6497324109077454, 0.9945715665817261, 0.9996709227561951, 0.702896773815155, 0.9987576007843018, 0.999886155128479, 0.9978757500648499, 0.9242936372756958, 0.49616625905036926, 0.43232759833335876, 0.5156563520431519, 0.5765033960342407, 0.9842455983161926, 0.7739431858062744, 0.6081187725067139, 0.9996530413627625, 0.3359259366989136, 0.5804523825645447, 0.5213574171066284, 0.9991923570632935, 0.9999047517776489, 0.6853982210159302, 0.9270474910736084, 0.4290043115615845, 0.5960231423377991, 0.6034378409385681, 0.9523364901542664, 0.8153638243675232, 0.3719821274280548, 0.978904128074646, 0.41557878255844116, 0.3846595585346222, 0.9686910510063171, 0.7718892097473145, 0.9756842255592346, 0.9999605417251587, 0.999944806098938, 0.5525913238525391, 0.22350147366523743, 0.8632689714431763, 0.7550030946731567, 0.9111226797103882, 0.9245912432670593, 0.6608228087425232, 0.2576390206813812, 0.9304094910621643, 0.4706200063228607, 0.9999743700027466, 0.989086389541626, 0.9999648928642273, 0.9997969269752502, 0.7710263729095459, 0.9524865746498108, 0.5595463514328003, 0.8536437749862671, 0.7377314567565918, 0.9999943971633911, 0.9066859483718872, 0.46307775378227234, 0.33840450644493103, 0.3781348466873169, 0.9999287128448486, 0.3654225468635559, 0.7422579526901245, 0.9975442886352539, 0.9522475004196167, 0.904500424861908, 0.4224333167076111, 0.9980615377426147, 0.6735483407974243, 0.9606912732124329, 0.6078675389289856, 0.9131925702095032, 0.9999622106552124, 0.7232492566108704, 0.38316091895103455, 0.892120361328125, 0.6087439656257629, 0.841572105884552, 1.0, 0.6278378963470459, 0.9510085582733154, 0.9438888430595398, 0.6143128871917725, 0.3431518077850342, 0.9932718276977539, 0.8422676920890808, 0.42350584268569946, 0.9873663783073425, 0.9999925494194031, 0.9999657273292542, 0.377641499042511, 0.7036289572715759, 0.9999561905860901, 0.9285649657249451, 0.9934513568878174, 0.999598503112793, 0.9999983310699463, 0.6890220046043396, 0.7017183899879456, 0.7757899761199951, 0.9998339414596558, 0.9257410764694214, 0.9999881386756897, 0.9999617338180542, 0.9998934268951416, 0.6634779572486877, 0.9854463338851929, 0.9530147314071655, 0.8885641694068909], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.49616625905036926}

Instead, it explains the reason behind the sentiment.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "c", "ause", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "itself", "does", "not", "convey", "any", "positive", "or", "negative", "emotion", "towards", "the", "subject", ",", "but", "rather", "describes", "an", "action", "or", "event", "that", "led", "to", "the", "sentiment", "expressed", "in", "the", "text", ".", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "text", "as", "a", "whole", "is", "negative", ",", "but", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "c", "ause", "'", "does", "not", "contribute", "to", "the", "sentiment", "expressed", "in", "the", "text", ".", "Instead", ",", "it", "explains", "the", "reason", "behind", "the", "sentiment", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8170081377029419, 0.782733678817749, 0.955146312713623, 0.8553736805915833, 0.9999839067459106, 0.5946487784385681, 0.9618761539459229, 0.6330418586730957, 0.9938254952430725, 0.9997744560241699, 0.8033314943313599, 0.9992740154266357, 0.9997668862342834, 0.9997512698173523, 0.7996594309806824, 0.36222052574157715, 0.3397422432899475, 0.7303223609924316, 0.5686146020889282, 0.9945850372314453, 0.4613843560218811, 0.8076671361923218, 0.999921441078186, 0.2754627764225006, 0.44706329703330994, 0.7308444976806641, 0.9996984601020813, 0.999960720539093, 0.5947688817977905, 0.37292107939720154, 0.9762231707572937, 0.6108995079994202, 0.44981077313423157, 0.4810238182544708, 0.8294328451156616, 0.37569111585617065, 0.6602624654769897, 0.9796550869941711, 0.765252947807312, 0.7614096403121948, 0.5587860941886902, 0.44504401087760925, 0.9999694228172302, 0.8101575970649719, 0.539336085319519, 0.9125861525535583, 0.9819811582565308, 0.9999790787696838, 0.9870625734329224, 0.9002230763435364, 0.5730980038642883, 0.6604058146476746, 0.364857017993927, 0.9989333152770996, 0.6442182064056396, 0.9662631750106812, 0.871916651725769, 0.7865771055221558, 0.9999192357063293, 0.9999996423721313, 0.8118123412132263, 0.9782573580741882, 0.7392711639404297, 0.5778557658195496, 0.571629524230957, 0.9371633529663086, 0.9980934858322144, 0.7914541959762573, 0.9999816417694092, 0.9998160004615784, 0.9999794960021973, 0.43311038613319397, 0.9999912977218628, 0.5124146938323975, 0.9921727180480957, 0.47957921028137207, 0.6314784288406372, 0.3340045213699341, 0.8183780312538147, 0.9995046257972717, 0.995130181312561, 0.5164766907691956, 0.33905068039894104, 0.9997825026512146, 0.9910045266151428, 0.40648674964904785, 0.912799060344696, 0.9868098497390747, 0.48876336216926575, 0.9415213465690613, 0.42704883217811584, 0.8232015371322632, 0.7936205863952637], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.36222052574157715}

This is a common sentiment subjectivity stereotype for phrases that express a desire for improvement or increased focus on a particular issue.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "of", "the", "phrase", "'", "should", "be", "higher", "'", "in", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", "is", "'", "pos", "itive", "'.", "The", "reason", "is", "that", "the", "phrase", "implies", "a", "desire", "for", "increased", "attention", "and", "prior", "it", "ization", ",", "which", "is", "generally", "considered", "a", "positive", "sentiment", ".", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", "=", "\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "should", "be", "higher", "'", "express", "es", "a", "desire", "for", "something", "to", "be", "given", "more", "importance", "or", "attention", ".", "In", "the", "context", "of", "the", "text", ",", "which", "is", "about", "recycl", "ing", "and", "waste", "management", "being", "more", "important", "than", "climate", "change", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "implies", "a", "positive", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "idea", "of", "giving", "more", "attention", "and", "resources", "to", "recycl", "ing", "and", "waste", "management", ".", "This", "is", "a", "common", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "stere", "otype", "for", "phrases", "that", "express", "a", "desire", "for", "improvement", "or", "increased", "focus", "on", "a", "particular", "issue", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7369397878646851, 0.9062121510505676, 0.9216981530189514, 0.5036709308624268, 0.9999812245368958, 0.4956546127796173, 0.8336859941482544, 0.3725672960281372, 0.6575114130973816, 0.9999457597732544, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9999990463256836, 0.999760091304779, 0.4763678014278412, 0.8055137395858765, 0.7941949963569641, 0.9490625858306885, 0.6608399748802185, 0.5162093639373779, 0.5390987992286682, 0.6610233187675476, 0.9336498379707336, 0.9999974966049194, 0.5947276949882507, 0.506136953830719, 0.5273022055625916, 0.8410013914108276, 0.9603686928749084, 0.9600499868392944, 0.462194561958313, 0.5885450839996338, 0.8232302665710449, 0.44817864894866943, 0.3933940827846527, 0.65554279088974, 0.29308760166168213, 0.729918360710144, 0.4512060880661011, 0.9999691247940063, 0.999964714050293, 0.4376944303512573, 0.8503889441490173, 0.5005673170089722, 0.7390291094779968, 0.5459302067756653, 0.9454429149627686, 0.9865165948867798, 0.9793627262115479, 0.3023485243320465, 0.2025068700313568, 0.9982998371124268, 0.7346165776252747, 0.9997726678848267, 0.9999942779541016, 0.6038197875022888, 0.9434030055999756, 0.8875552415847778, 0.6599462032318115, 0.62782883644104, 0.9421443939208984, 0.9999865293502808, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9999807476997375, 0.9997538924217224, 0.33870789408683777, 0.9999947547912598, 0.990551233291626, 0.6038040518760681, 0.5103550553321838, 0.31594377756118774, 0.9094513654708862, 0.7394771575927734, 0.9156287908554077, 0.8756237030029297, 0.9296715259552002, 0.8383429646492004, 0.49847888946533203, 0.7098637819290161, 0.8068078756332397, 0.8678935170173645, 0.9528214335441589, 0.999986469745636, 0.9989495277404785, 0.976422905921936, 0.6717478632926941, 0.45711907744407654, 0.39295604825019836, 0.7137702107429504, 0.9784188866615295, 1.0, 0.9969602823257446, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9999969005584717, 0.8147892951965332, 0.5709086656570435, 0.9874027967453003, 0.99992835521698, 0.9999746680259705, 0.9999913573265076, 0.9999179244041443, 0.5108655691146851, 0.7646707892417908, 0.6707553863525391, 0.28288984298706055, 0.7723146080970764, 0.9168666005134583, 0.8842860460281372, 0.8831497430801392, 0.5236808061599731, 0.7139009833335876, 0.9705784320831299, 0.7198622822761536, 0.7193440198898315, 0.4083630442619324, 0.7373442053794861, 0.39468327164649963, 0.9994702339172363, 0.9517456889152527, 1.0, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9999999403953552, 0.999997079372406, 0.995559811592102, 0.5205937623977661, 0.6404849886894226, 0.5050381422042847, 0.5037235021591187, 0.9674564599990845, 0.784359335899353, 0.9999535083770752, 0.9925847053527832, 0.9999586343765259, 0.6152068972587585, 0.7484388947486877, 0.7565800547599792, 0.6789195537567139, 0.9770937561988831, 0.9543172121047974, 0.839867353439331, 0.3676075041294098, 0.9694687724113464, 0.8741010427474976, 0.5978633761405945, 0.8384830951690674, 0.7933273911476135, 0.9741007685661316, 0.9574825763702393, 0.9725318551063538, 0.6830608248710632], "st_polarity_prediction": "positive", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.9336498379707336}
