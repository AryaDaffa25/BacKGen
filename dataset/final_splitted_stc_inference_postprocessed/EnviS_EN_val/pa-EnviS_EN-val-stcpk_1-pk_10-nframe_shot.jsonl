However, it is important to note that the sentiment towards the overall text appears to be negative, as it expresses frustration and disappointment with the response to flooding in Nigeria or Lagos.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "f", "lo", "od", "in", "a", "san", "er", "cl", "ime", "\"", "is", "neutral", ".", "The", "phrase", "itself", "does", "not", "express", "any", "positive", "or", "negative", "emotion", "towards", "the", "flood", ",", "but", "rather", "comp", "ares", "it", "to", "a", "hyp", "ot", "het", "ical", "\"", "san", "er", "cl", "ime", "\"", "where", "the", "response", "to", "the", "flood", "might", "be", "different", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "provided", "does", "not", "offer", "enough", "context", "to", "determine", "the", "sentiment", "pol", "arity", "of", "the", "phrase", ".", "However", ",", "it", "is", "important", "to", "note", "that", "the", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "overall", "text", "appears", "to", "be", "negative", ",", "as", "it", "express", "es", "frustration", "and", "disappointment", "with", "the", "response", "to", "flo", "oding", "in", "Nigeria", "or", "Lag", "os", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.5739040374755859, 0.6502920985221863, 0.9943311214447021, 0.6163339614868164, 0.9999918341636658, 0.5419836640357971, 0.9530904293060303, 0.5641269087791443, 0.999881386756897, 0.7345151901245117, 0.999826192855835, 0.9998751878738403, 0.999998152256012, 0.9999999403953552, 1.0, 0.99992835521698, 0.9995968341827393, 0.999667227268219, 0.9999865889549255, 0.9999440312385559, 0.958931028842926, 0.8222935199737549, 0.3612869083881378, 0.6265935301780701, 0.6396482586860657, 0.45464006066322327, 0.6161769032478333, 0.9999573230743408, 0.567704975605011, 0.40127167105674744, 0.333852082490921, 0.9994807243347168, 0.9998329281806946, 0.5895522236824036, 0.4366106390953064, 0.9951619505882263, 0.7369726896286011, 0.2886081635951996, 0.8996405005455017, 0.8689526319503784, 0.3007296621799469, 0.9999974966049194, 0.5498365759849548, 0.9805238842964172, 0.8766868114471436, 0.6717482209205627, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9996935725212097, 0.9996938705444336, 0.5346243381500244, 0.9637595415115356, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9859352707862854, 0.9999960064888, 0.5284618139266968, 0.3123328387737274, 0.9032618403434753, 0.2467905431985855, 0.8951943516731262, 0.6637828350067139, 0.985002338886261, 0.8343347907066345, 0.9965210556983948, 0.980583131313324, 0.9173347353935242, 0.5976993441581726, 0.6164167523384094, 0.9945369958877563, 0.6721451282501221, 0.8842703700065613, 0.9854435920715332, 0.22031842172145844, 0.38328656554222107, 0.9058283567428589, 0.9568610787391663, 0.7727269530296326, 0.3784964382648468, 0.9692125916481018, 0.47623229026794434, 0.9999995231628418, 0.5222636461257935, 0.9036229252815247, 0.6318600177764893, 0.4778922200202942, 0.2667914927005768, 0.9999942183494568, 0.5585919618606567, 0.6382262110710144, 0.46216249465942383, 0.9999873638153076, 0.8483441472053528, 0.997875988483429, 0.29845482110977173, 0.26575103402137756, 0.3314991891384125, 0.47894617915153503, 0.30545297265052795, 0.6101941466331482, 0.32152315974235535, 0.9888984560966492, 0.9102725982666016, 0.8364176154136658, 0.7769917249679565, 0.6561191082000732, 0.5929796099662781, 0.78058922290802, 0.9999934434890747, 0.671483039855957, 0.7969964146614075, 0.42138242721557617, 0.5134460926055908, 0.9728146195411682, 0.306849867105484, 0.9952464699745178, 0.6797702312469482, 0.9999979138374329, 0.9855231642723083, 0.8733680844306946, 0.8980948328971863, 0.9999651908874512, 0.9997075200080872, 0.4665571451187134, 0.6406676769256592], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.8222935199737549}

The background knowledge about the lack of awareness and understanding can help contextualize this sentiment phrase and support the classification of negative sentiment subjectivity.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", ".", "The", "use", "of", "the", "der", "og", "atory", "term", "\"", "de", "colon", "ization", "shit", "\"", "suggests", "a", "negative", "attitude", "towards", "the", "concept", "of", "dec", "ol", "on", "ization", "and", "the", "efforts", "to", "promote", "it", ".", "This", "term", "is", "often", "used", "in", "a", "dismiss", "ive", "or", "der", "is", "ive", "way", ",", "imp", "lying", "a", "lack", "of", "understanding", "or", "appreciation", "for", "the", "importance", "of", "dec", "ol", "on", "ization", "and", "its", "potential", "benefits", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "about", "the", "lack", "of", "awareness", "and", "understanding", "can", "help", "context", "ual", "ize", "this", "sentiment", "phrase", "and", "support", "the", "classification", "of", "negative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.47371813654899597, 0.5636823773384094, 0.9999960064888, 0.8140968084335327, 0.9787557125091553, 0.9999790787696838, 0.38267067074775696, 0.9315862059593201, 0.41018936038017273, 0.9999991655349731, 0.7995966076850891, 0.5981267094612122, 0.9996474385261536, 0.9989664554595947, 0.9634318947792053, 0.6028469204902649, 0.4693266451358795, 0.9998683929443359, 0.9999968409538269, 0.999017596244812, 0.9974955916404724, 0.32624736428260803, 0.9429940581321716, 0.6759693622589111, 0.6607908606529236, 0.9630251526832581, 0.9096762537956238, 0.4676150679588318, 0.9644318222999573, 0.9981168508529663, 0.999996542930603, 0.9999164938926697, 0.9987885355949402, 0.528125524520874, 0.3325059115886688, 0.265062153339386, 0.5934094190597534, 0.42698222398757935, 0.5603545904159546, 0.6448097825050354, 0.36918172240257263, 0.26247331500053406, 0.35398632287979126, 0.7360773086547852, 0.8147485256195068, 0.3593316078186035, 0.9778239130973816, 0.5631820559501648, 0.9999978542327881, 0.7007001042366028, 0.5458970069885254, 0.7958078384399414, 0.9994751214981079, 0.559751033782959, 0.5117467045783997, 0.39783763885498047, 0.9999943971633911, 0.7308984398841858, 0.990923285484314, 0.999991238117218, 0.9151164889335632, 0.8554201722145081, 0.8101194500923157, 0.9880571961402893, 0.9377087950706482, 0.7108965516090393, 0.6279811859130859, 0.8654924035072327, 0.9999788403511047, 0.9994671940803528, 0.9856807589530945, 0.7132483720779419, 0.5248846411705017, 0.7115469574928284, 0.491830974817276, 0.6239678859710693, 0.5565870404243469, 0.531322181224823, 0.9993973970413208, 0.36076244711875916, 0.6953871846199036, 0.3676009774208069, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9988267421722412, 0.9892454147338867, 0.9698110818862915, 0.2340676486492157, 0.3972785174846649, 0.5292434692382812, 0.9997240304946899, 0.9997517466545105, 0.6868979334831238, 0.9253637194633484, 0.5933691263198853, 0.6238563060760498, 0.45555025339126587, 0.971849799156189, 0.8354453444480896, 0.8346871137619019, 0.9799928665161133, 0.9994662404060364, 0.9999299645423889, 0.999998152256012, 0.9977810382843018, 0.9849041700363159], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.5636823773384094}

The background knowledge about the importance of preventing harm to the environment and the negative consequences of prioritizing wealth and power over public safety further supports the classification of negative sentiment subjectivity.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "not", "the", "ch", "inese", "\"", "implies", "a", "negative", "comparison", ",", "suggesting", "that", "the", "speaker", "believes", "the", "Chinese", "are", "doing", "something", "und", "es", "irable", "or", "harmful", ",", "likely", "related", "to", "the", "dr", "illing", "of", "oil", "or", "other", "environmental", "concerns", ".", "This", "negative", "sentiment", "is", "in", "contrast", "to", "the", "positive", "sentiment", "expressed", "towards", "\"", "g", "reat", "Americans", "\"", "and", "the", "desire", "for", "them", "to", "dr", "ill", "oil", "instead", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "about", "the", "importance", "of", "preventing", "harm", "to", "the", "environment", "and", "the", "negative", "consequences", "of", "prior", "it", "izing", "wealth", "and", "power", "over", "public", "safety", "further", "supports", "the", "classification", "of", "negative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7199226021766663, 0.6996276378631592, 0.9999986290931702, 0.9723060727119446, 0.9969797730445862, 0.9999908208847046, 0.35402750968933105, 0.9230805039405823, 0.8218085169792175, 0.9904093742370605, 0.6166120767593384, 0.9994686841964722, 0.9999983310699463, 0.9499458074569702, 0.9990822672843933, 0.9997122883796692, 0.4410479664802551, 0.9786598682403564, 0.6418082118034363, 0.7000806331634521, 0.2876318693161011, 0.5700583457946777, 0.8306451439857483, 0.8997533321380615, 0.5374658703804016, 0.4073467552661896, 0.7957025170326233, 0.990813136100769, 0.7839913368225098, 0.32611119747161865, 0.9995815753936768, 0.7947375774383545, 0.9999991655349731, 0.999992311000824, 0.5780220031738281, 0.8522430062294006, 0.5960030555725098, 0.1861063838005066, 0.5130012035369873, 0.999993085861206, 0.5758956670761108, 0.320656955242157, 0.9999838471412659, 0.667462170124054, 0.9999340176582336, 0.35263580083847046, 0.253713458776474, 0.49631819128990173, 0.6124799251556396, 0.5854698419570923, 0.5665012001991272, 0.445497989654541, 0.6325307488441467, 0.664016604423523, 0.46058663725852966, 0.9334237575531006, 0.9937993884086609, 0.9637187719345093, 0.44554054737091064, 0.9554774165153503, 0.9441142678260803, 0.899318516254425, 0.5703965425491333, 0.6617180705070496, 0.9999983906745911, 0.9852390289306641, 0.8926196694374084, 0.421810507774353, 0.753032386302948, 0.9570649862289429, 0.9409677386283875, 0.6757705807685852, 0.9997622966766357, 0.6067734360694885, 0.9999964237213135, 0.9245729446411133, 0.4906688630580902, 0.706870436668396, 0.6078998446464539, 0.5605390071868896, 0.9985992908477783, 0.4781051576137543, 0.7198731899261475, 0.5013749599456787, 0.9999896287918091, 0.5849254727363586, 0.9979233145713806, 0.9999775290489197, 0.9999851584434509, 0.999998152256012, 0.6738559603691101, 0.756277859210968, 0.49387603998184204, 0.4790337383747101, 0.9861153960227966, 0.9654735922813416, 0.9999933838844299, 0.9999590516090393, 0.4577069580554962, 0.9823681116104126, 0.9998375177383423, 0.9565854072570801, 0.33496686816215515, 0.992845892906189, 0.30648303031921387, 0.7310889363288879, 0.8303571343421936, 0.94000244140625, 0.9953234791755676, 0.8288589715957642, 0.999933123588562, 0.999329149723053, 0.9999986290931702, 0.8976073861122131, 0.9956008791923523], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.6996276378631592}

The negative sentiment towards 'junk science' is a common stereotype in the context of scientific research and its potential impact on public health and well-being.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "j", "unk", "science", "'", "is", "negative", ".", "This", "is", "because", "the", "phrase", "'", "j", "unk", "science", "'", "is", "often", "used", "to", "describe", "scientific", "research", "that", "is", "considered", "to", "be", "flaw", "ed", ",", "unre", "li", "able", ",", "or", "based", "on", "ins", "ufficient", "evidence", ",", "and", "is", "therefore", "not", "trust", "worthy", "or", "cred", "ible", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "speaker", "is", "express", "ing", "their", "dis", "d", "ain", "for", "the", "scientific", "research", "that", "Bill", "G", "ates", "and", "Hillary", "Clinton", "alleg", "edly", "rel", "ied", "on", "to", "justify", "their", "investments", "in", "circum", "c", "ision", "in", "Africa", ",", "imp", "lying", "that", "it", "was", "not", "based", "on", "sound", "scientific", "principles", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "'", "j", "unk", "science", "'", "is", "a", "common", "stere", "otype", "in", "the", "context", "of", "scientific", "research", "and", "its", "potential", "impact", "on", "public", "health", "and", "well", "-", "being", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8226796984672546, 0.5284460783004761, 0.9855247735977173, 0.7354092597961426, 0.9999968409538269, 0.7127834558486938, 0.9695128202438354, 0.5666543245315552, 0.9984216690063477, 0.9999091029167175, 0.6219178438186646, 0.9999955296516418, 0.999998152256012, 0.999984860420227, 0.9999843835830688, 0.9905787706375122, 0.5176456570625305, 0.4476599395275116, 0.5262052416801453, 0.6745185852050781, 0.9072427749633789, 0.9701977372169495, 0.3975342810153961, 0.4487985074520111, 0.9999970197677612, 0.9999949336051941, 0.9999844431877136, 0.9999908208847046, 0.6869300603866577, 0.8391790390014648, 0.9541519284248352, 0.9846000075340271, 0.5688305497169495, 0.767113447189331, 0.3837604820728302, 0.5537876486778259, 0.9665663242340088, 0.48047953844070435, 0.5565263628959656, 0.99959397315979, 0.36572468280792236, 1.0, 0.9365132451057434, 0.8562989830970764, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9894234538078308, 0.993244469165802, 0.25814810395240784, 0.9999709725379944, 0.8647279739379883, 0.9966697692871094, 0.9824487566947937, 0.5154340267181396, 0.4875040352344513, 0.5015134215354919, 0.7367802858352661, 0.7020219564437866, 0.5389840602874756, 0.9999226927757263, 0.9075729846954346, 0.31999287009239197, 0.9999929070472717, 0.9600892066955566, 0.5454497337341309, 0.558505654335022, 0.87508624792099, 0.9999703764915466, 0.9796476364135742, 0.5312486290931702, 0.7546657919883728, 0.8281635046005249, 0.9999995231628418, 0.729835569858551, 0.4102024734020233, 0.8050521612167358, 0.9999991655349731, 0.7401418685913086, 0.632091760635376, 0.2561025619506836, 0.4883716106414795, 0.8561455607414246, 0.9588748812675476, 0.9999055862426758, 1.0, 0.9998812675476074, 0.9959813952445984, 0.9999820590019226, 0.6952304840087891, 0.9999978542327881, 0.7142979502677917, 1.0, 0.8584756255149841, 0.9298396110534668, 0.5647196173667908, 0.8724468946456909, 0.42614999413490295, 0.9788897633552551, 0.9786497950553894, 0.9999991655349731, 0.6259596347808838, 0.9318281412124634, 0.9966158866882324, 0.6703745722770691, 0.8376850485801697, 0.999995231628418, 0.9998005032539368, 0.3901021480560303, 0.994267463684082, 0.6867313981056213, 0.8617938756942749, 0.9999944567680359, 0.8546379804611206, 0.6444198489189148, 0.7532893419265747, 0.5261152982711792, 0.36675724387168884, 0.47094273567199707, 0.8632972836494446, 0.686657726764679, 0.8691752552986145, 0.9999933838844299, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9999896883964539, 0.9999485611915588, 0.6882285475730896, 0.4164523184299469, 0.9453060626983643, 0.8499985933303833, 0.999988853931427, 0.2925691306591034, 0.6386978626251221, 0.4781723916530609, 0.9988158345222473, 0.8586000204086304, 0.9287002682685852, 0.5870240926742554, 0.5906069278717041, 0.8675493001937866, 0.5191425681114197, 0.9998700022697449, 0.6593104600906372, 0.9955183267593384, 0.9807797074317932, 0.5557970404624939, 0.6272891759872437, 0.9999579787254333, 0.9247893691062927, 0.8387628197669983], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.5176456570625305}

The background knowledge about the negative consequences of misinformation and the importance of contributing to positive change further supports the classification of negative sentiment subjectivity.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["Neg", "ative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", ".", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "that", "'", "s", "bullshit", "\"", "express", "es", "a", "strong", "negative", "emotion", "towards", "the", "topic", "being", "discussed", ",", "which", "in", "this", "case", "is", "Dem", "eter", "'", "s", "food", "production", "and", "health", "claims", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "is", "not", "related", "to", "the", "actual", "quality", "or", "health", "benefits", "of", "Dem", "eter", "'", "s", "products", ",", "but", "rather", "the", "spread", "of", "mis", "information", "and", "the", "use", "of", "strong", "language", "to", "express", "frustration", "or", "ske", "ptic", "ism", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "about", "the", "negative", "consequences", "of", "mis", "information", "and", "the", "importance", "of", "contributing", "to", "positive", "change", "further", "supports", "the", "classification", "of", "negative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.3521638810634613, 0.9999957084655762, 0.5915359854698181, 0.6975594758987427, 0.9998777508735657, 0.2560623586177826, 0.9390714168548584, 0.3902669847011566, 0.991477906703949, 0.509343147277832, 0.9984039068222046, 0.999796450138092, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9098051190376282, 0.9999305009841919, 0.6024156808853149, 0.9999920725822449, 0.712470293045044, 0.7857083678245544, 0.917044460773468, 0.8292957544326782, 0.8146733641624451, 0.9835835099220276, 0.5742794871330261, 0.39662840962409973, 0.9998904466629028, 0.8915519118309021, 0.6571388840675354, 0.59941166639328, 0.9993013739585876, 0.979783833026886, 0.9534406661987305, 0.5867535471916199, 0.9999951124191284, 0.8161056041717529, 0.9999974966049194, 0.5675410628318787, 0.5451427698135376, 0.84951251745224, 0.9447806477546692, 0.9870418906211853, 0.948305070400238, 0.6767915487289429, 0.43186432123184204, 0.9732517004013062, 0.30932295322418213, 0.435210645198822, 0.28323429822921753, 0.9996052980422974, 0.8099636435508728, 0.28412559628486633, 0.5801364779472351, 0.6723194718360901, 0.9460407495498657, 0.9939748644828796, 0.999996542930603, 0.635138750076294, 0.9999978542327881, 0.999623715877533, 0.9999961853027344, 0.9980841875076294, 0.6935641169548035, 0.9942223429679871, 0.9936006665229797, 0.5006341338157654, 0.5607061982154846, 0.9999997019767761, 0.8112488985061646, 0.999299168586731, 0.8252923488616943, 0.7081950902938843, 0.1853499710559845, 0.9999979138374329, 0.45772647857666016, 0.9880561232566833, 0.8683569431304932, 0.7774487733840942, 0.8215025067329407, 0.66291344165802, 0.4104427099227905, 0.9999939203262329, 0.9999982118606567, 0.8378889560699463, 0.5418440103530884, 0.3945465385913849, 0.9998109340667725, 0.6518757343292236, 0.9544228315353394, 0.9114607572555542, 0.9978123307228088, 0.999997079372406, 0.9372346997261047, 0.9999794960021973, 0.47922268509864807, 0.9244821667671204, 0.8539576530456543, 0.9999929070472717, 0.4979507327079773, 0.9883716106414795, 0.9997990727424622, 0.9902202486991882, 0.3063551187515259, 0.6742861866950989, 0.9417999982833862, 0.9812837243080139, 0.9980716705322266, 0.9501375555992126, 0.9999469518661499, 0.9996235966682434, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9486454129219055, 0.9953858256340027], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.3521638810634613}
