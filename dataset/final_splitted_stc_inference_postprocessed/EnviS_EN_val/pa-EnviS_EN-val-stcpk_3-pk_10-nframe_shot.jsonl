Therefore, the negative sentiment towards problems is consistent with both the text and the background knowledge.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "pro", "ble", "ms", "'", "in", "the", "text", "is", "negative", "in", "pol", "arity", ".", "The", "text", "suggests", "that", "people", "may", "find", "it", "easier", "to", "understand", "and", "address", "immediate", "problems", ",", "such", "as", "hunger", "and", "cold", ",", "compared", "to", "slow", "-", "decl", "ining", "issues", ",", "like", "the", "decline", "of", "medical", "care", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "also", "indicates", "that", "numerous", "problems", "and", "threats", "exist", ",", "which", "require", "urgent", "attention", "and", "action", ",", "and", "that", "the", "slow", "pace", "of", "change", "regarding", "issues", "like", "climate", "change", "is", "a", "major", "problem", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "problems", "is", "consistent", "with", "both", "the", "text", "and", "the", "background", "knowledge", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9664629101753235, 0.6184881329536438, 0.6638926267623901, 0.9726716876029968, 0.8806114196777344, 0.9999468922615051, 0.9999909400939941, 1.0, 0.9973811507225037, 0.4549132287502289, 0.8926737308502197, 0.5911233425140381, 0.5035884976387024, 0.31644105911254883, 0.32773593068122864, 0.9065350890159607, 0.9999974966049194, 0.8337598443031311, 0.6458891034126282, 0.39377647638320923, 0.45188647508621216, 0.9948874115943909, 0.6589389443397522, 0.42280125617980957, 0.9447769522666931, 0.9467331171035767, 0.9983357787132263, 0.9999939203262329, 0.6453061103820801, 0.9430375695228577, 0.46032631397247314, 0.5152087807655334, 0.7677801251411438, 0.8070148825645447, 0.872821569442749, 0.9999712705612183, 0.9844071269035339, 0.9936245679855347, 0.9911039471626282, 0.9914045929908752, 0.587242066860199, 0.9998999238014221, 0.2191307544708252, 0.5516259670257568, 0.4400910437107086, 0.9617460370063782, 0.9040816426277161, 0.639293372631073, 0.6904001235961914, 0.7989076375961304, 0.4604948163032532, 0.9732503294944763, 0.9985241293907166, 0.9999855160713196, 0.9361327886581421, 0.579073965549469, 0.41481563448905945, 0.9760010838508606, 0.45926225185394287, 0.19502007961273193, 0.7004756331443787, 0.42841029167175293, 0.9472989439964294, 0.7032569646835327, 0.9173421859741211, 0.4737454056739807, 0.45507368445396423, 0.38664665818214417, 0.5078984498977661, 0.6516032218933105, 0.9943594932556152, 0.8970438241958618, 0.960005521774292, 0.5233938694000244, 0.45484670996665955, 0.5420135855674744, 0.37203896045684814, 0.5346534848213196, 0.999755859375, 0.9999751448631287, 0.9994634389877319, 0.6688867807388306, 0.43734505772590637, 0.879757821559906, 0.9969064593315125, 0.9998849034309387, 0.521551251411438, 0.9255756139755249, 0.952372670173645, 0.920900285243988, 0.8423214554786682, 0.31773149967193604, 0.9999816417694092, 0.8812875747680664, 0.5744863748550415, 0.7063554525375366, 0.3416544795036316, 0.457427978515625, 0.6087105870246887, 0.6870177984237671, 0.9182378053665161, 0.5068240761756897, 0.9999762177467346, 0.9851304292678833, 0.9992296099662781, 0.8435418009757996, 0.988735020160675, 0.9958109855651855, 0.9988311529159546, 0.9432163238525391], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.31644105911254883}

In this context, the speaker is expressing their inability to fully grasp the implications of the slow decline of medical care, comparing it to the more immediate and tangible problems of hunger and cold. The negative sentiment in the background knowledge, particularly the first sentence about distorted understanding of reality, supports the classification of this phrase as negative. The speaker's inability to fully comprehend the situation may indicate a lack of awareness or understanding, which can be a barrier to taking positive action.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "phrase", "'", "can", "'", "t", "imagine", "'", "express", "es", "a", "lack", "of", "ability", "to", "env", "ision", "or", "understand", "a", "situation", ",", "which", "can", "often", "be", "associated", "with", "feelings", "of", "frustration", ",", "helpless", "ness", ",", "or", "uncertainty", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "the", "speaker", "is", "express", "ing", "their", "in", "ability", "to", "fully", "grasp", "the", "implications", "of", "the", "slow", "decline", "of", "medical", "care", ",", "comparing", "it", "to", "the", "more", "immediate", "and", "tang", "ible", "problems", "of", "hunger", "and", "cold", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", ",", "particularly", "the", "first", "sentence", "about", "dist", "orted", "understanding", "of", "reality", ",", "supports", "the", "classification", "of", "this", "phrase", "as", "negative", ".", "The", "speaker", "'", "s", "in", "ability", "to", "fully", "compre", "hend", "the", "situation", "may", "indicate", "a", "lack", "of", "awareness", "or", "understanding", ",", "which", "can", "be", "a", "barrier", "to", "taking", "positive", "action", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.90407395362854, 0.6709417700767517, 0.9999949336051941, 0.5746524930000305, 0.9030954837799072, 0.976048469543457, 0.9999390840530396, 0.9999273419380188, 0.9982863664627075, 0.8710778951644897, 0.8115401268005371, 0.48068687319755554, 0.9078097343444824, 0.9998592138290405, 0.940581202507019, 0.9999943971633911, 0.9999023079872131, 0.9971885681152344, 0.21651394665241241, 0.9999579191207886, 0.859002947807312, 0.3804735541343689, 0.9962916374206543, 0.8824276328086853, 0.7860361933708191, 0.32439953088760376, 0.9982491135597229, 0.5066359639167786, 0.3241366744041443, 0.8124369978904724, 0.846901535987854, 0.3652361035346985, 0.47466105222702026, 0.5574407577514648, 0.47217264771461487, 0.5375552177429199, 0.48946571350097656, 0.9999918341636658, 0.4178696274757385, 0.9996188282966614, 0.33132731914520264, 0.9109521508216858, 0.30372118949890137, 0.9999968409538269, 0.9199539422988892, 0.9631483554840088, 0.4394914507865906, 0.9567338824272156, 0.48033466935157776, 0.596656858921051, 0.8448141813278198, 0.999066174030304, 0.6404120326042175, 0.4067990779876709, 0.47197359800338745, 0.24178236722946167, 0.9999957084655762, 0.42628219723701477, 0.6274948716163635, 0.9999842643737793, 0.9998787641525269, 0.48706331849098206, 0.5265101790428162, 0.9960706830024719, 0.31139716506004333, 0.9672867059707642, 0.515659749507904, 0.5891420841217041, 0.9863048195838928, 0.888276219367981, 0.9991369843482971, 0.9999698996543884, 0.5116227865219116, 0.5929823517799377, 0.9998565316200256, 0.9956652522087097, 0.46323660016059875, 0.49876561760902405, 0.9750170111656189, 0.6248491406440735, 0.4896852970123291, 0.9999955892562866, 0.8134737014770508, 0.9957019090652466, 0.9990732669830322, 0.9999873638153076, 0.9998719096183777, 0.9751317501068115, 0.5143123269081116, 0.6904850602149963, 0.88077312707901, 0.5747496485710144, 0.8045222163200378, 0.9186798930168152, 0.9421296715736389, 0.4507617950439453, 0.2958148121833801, 0.6087546348571777, 0.21535778045654297, 0.8928999304771423, 0.5558149814605713, 0.4087510406970978, 0.9996796250343323, 0.7792304158210754, 0.9041590094566345, 0.999998152256012, 0.6664614081382751, 0.35010695457458496, 0.6205495595932007, 0.8396314978599548, 0.9864895939826965, 0.6615592837333679, 0.94355708360672, 0.9995496273040771, 0.9571113586425781, 0.9186360239982605, 0.41480883955955505, 0.13971014320850372, 0.699720561504364, 0.999998152256012, 0.5940728783607483, 0.999994695186615, 0.9996865391731262, 0.6450144648551941, 0.6864302158355713, 0.9999961853027344, 0.9010487198829651, 0.6464320421218872, 0.46740248799324036, 0.413178026676178, 0.9596067667007446, 0.6878777146339417, 0.9999943971633911, 0.8534217476844788, 0.9409486055374146, 0.9028267860412598, 0.9374659657478333, 0.8366358876228333, 0.7918947339057922, 0.5890215039253235, 0.6339834332466125, 0.41120022535324097, 0.9999799728393555, 0.8555135130882263, 0.699044942855835, 0.7453698515892029, 0.39261794090270996, 0.8569763898849487], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.6709417700767517}

In this context, the speaker is expressing that both nuclear and renewable energy sources have a low risk level, which is a desirable quality when it comes to energy production.

Therefore, a decrease in costs due to sustainable product design can be seen as a positive outcome, even though the text as a whole acknowledges that cost increases are a common concern.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "de", "cre", "ase", "in", "costs", "'", "is", "a", "positive", "statement", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "does", "not", "directly", "support", "this", "classification", ",", "but", "it", "does", "provide", "context", "that", "can", "help", "explain", "why", "a", "decrease", "in", "costs", "can", "be", "a", "positive", "outcome", ".", "The", "second", "background", "sentence", "states", "that", "investing", "in", "e", "co", "-", "friendly", "products", "is", "a", "wise", "financial", "decision", ".", "This", "implies", "that", "cost", "savings", "can", "be", "an", "important", "benefit", "of", "sustainable", "product", "design", ".", "Therefore", ",", "a", "decrease", "in", "costs", "due", "to", "sustainable", "product", "design", "can", "be", "seen", "as", "a", "positive", "outcome", ",", "even", "though", "the", "text", "as", "a", "whole", "acknowled", "ges", "that", "cost", "increases", "are", "a", "common", "concern", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9843239188194275, 0.5211042165756226, 0.5128827691078186, 0.9993064403533936, 0.7017984390258789, 0.9833055734634399, 0.9999683499336243, 0.9782601594924927, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9999807476997375, 0.9987857341766357, 0.6967695951461792, 0.5739789009094238, 0.9908321499824524, 0.4129357635974884, 0.40594547986984253, 0.29084229469299316, 0.8126869201660156, 0.875419020652771, 0.34875786304473877, 0.9772039651870728, 0.3882717788219452, 0.2064901739358902, 0.6086524724960327, 0.7313587665557861, 0.707057774066925, 0.9635767340660095, 0.7322589755058289, 0.44469964504241943, 0.43773379921913147, 0.6981133222579956, 0.6333411931991577, 0.18128438293933868, 0.8103920817375183, 0.5923692584037781, 0.6381887197494507, 0.6187726259231567, 0.9873712658882141, 0.9999969005584717, 0.999788224697113, 0.2825995683670044, 0.9210747480392456, 0.6889687180519104, 0.5589072108268738, 0.9106203317642212, 0.35527458786964417, 0.49612417817115784, 0.5727679133415222, 0.8211503028869629, 0.9812644124031067, 0.2075822949409485, 0.9575719237327576, 0.818632185459137, 0.999961256980896, 0.956275999546051, 1.0, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9995510578155518, 0.9970490336418152, 0.9614324569702148, 0.9978041052818298, 0.5878490209579468, 0.9998458027839661, 0.9999846816062927, 0.7367662191390991, 0.40622979402542114, 0.45734739303588867, 0.9996743202209473, 0.44055768847465515, 0.9678978323936462, 0.8513191342353821, 0.9665360450744629, 0.47745007276535034, 0.3901495933532715, 0.7341839671134949, 0.9780070185661316, 0.9128664135932922, 0.8546441793441772, 0.9988161325454712, 0.6188732385635376, 0.469580739736557, 0.9999374151229858, 0.7038635611534119, 0.9922498464584351, 0.9999961853027344, 0.9998608231544495, 0.5362889766693115, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9794749021530151, 0.9259819984436035, 0.9996839761734009, 0.6109366416931152, 0.8947232961654663, 0.6868205666542053, 0.9997496008872986, 0.9973974227905273, 0.8947960138320923, 0.5844745635986328, 0.5042652487754822, 0.5800147652626038, 0.6329335570335388, 0.9286774396896362, 0.5709466338157654, 0.3524661660194397, 0.9957733154296875, 0.999999463558197, 0.4667963981628418, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9471421241760254, 0.25421881675720215, 0.9470973014831543, 0.5235139727592468, 0.6739223599433899, 0.9748116731643677, 0.6926790475845337, 0.7177066206932068, 0.5353058576583862], "st_polarity_prediction": "positive", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.9908321499824524}

The second background sentence, with its positive sentiment, supports this interpretation.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "t", "ow", "ards", "'", "is", "a", "pre", "position", "that", "indicates", "direction", "or", "progress", "ion", "towards", "a", "goal", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "it", "is", "used", "in", "the", "context", "of", "a", "series", "of", "reports", "that", "cover", "various", "topics", "related", "to", "urban", "mobility", ",", "citizen", "engagement", ",", "and", "climate", "action", ".", "Given", "the", "background", "knowledge", ",", "the", "sentiment", "associated", "with", "the", "phrase", "'", "t", "ow", "ards", "'", "is", "positive", ",", "as", "it", "implies", "progress", "and", "development", "towards", "a", "better", "future", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "in", "the", "first", "background", "sentence", "does", "not", "directly", "apply", "to", "the", "target", "phrase", ",", "as", "it", "refers", "to", "the", "potential", "negative", "impact", "of", "ide", "ologies", "and", "govern", "ance", "structures", ",", "not", "the", "concept", "of", "progress", "ing", "towards", "a", "goal", ".", "The", "second", "background", "sentence", ",", "with", "its", "positive", "sentiment", ",", "supports", "this", "interpretation", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9727011322975159, 0.4889103174209595, 0.43297457695007324, 0.9777926802635193, 0.8846395015716553, 0.9998279809951782, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9999086260795593, 0.9975598454475403, 0.3083861768245697, 0.4446569085121155, 0.6431968808174133, 0.9999722838401794, 0.40804797410964966, 0.3579646050930023, 0.4357123374938965, 0.38676804304122925, 0.45606324076652527, 0.9857488870620728, 0.4737125039100647, 0.9352574944496155, 0.8900691866874695, 0.7463748455047607, 0.5040629506111145, 0.7816880345344543, 0.8596630692481995, 0.9987568259239197, 0.4721766412258148, 0.5445091724395752, 0.20292048156261444, 0.6070206165313721, 0.6703142523765564, 0.37290287017822266, 0.999448835849762, 0.31980377435684204, 0.7774543762207031, 0.9996721744537354, 0.6792658567428589, 0.32412153482437134, 0.5037118196487427, 0.5862860083580017, 0.3856504261493683, 0.7423403263092041, 0.9999522566795349, 0.6625891327857971, 0.685850203037262, 0.9148555994033813, 0.8488277792930603, 0.7666445374488831, 0.9864387512207031, 0.8972033858299255, 0.9971266984939575, 0.9988561272621155, 0.5005145072937012, 0.4240816533565521, 0.6729903221130371, 0.44435304403305054, 0.9341060519218445, 0.6179619431495667, 0.5654115080833435, 0.2116783708333969, 0.4774458408355713, 0.9996743202209473, 0.4252813756465912, 0.7016309499740601, 0.7699815034866333, 0.9904720187187195, 0.9999904632568359, 0.9996522068977356, 0.9865996837615967, 0.7976921796798706, 0.6903321146965027, 0.32542669773101807, 0.9649142026901245, 0.8174543976783752, 0.5618520379066467, 0.5962158441543579, 0.5085800290107727, 0.20732788741588593, 0.8010905981063843, 0.7675743103027344, 0.569698691368103, 0.9978110194206238, 0.9288912415504456, 0.3851179778575897, 0.5724589824676514, 0.7990851402282715, 0.4814354181289673, 0.9233376979827881, 0.602707028388977, 0.9212204217910767, 0.9731070399284363, 0.6055923700332642, 0.9999039173126221, 0.5421716570854187, 0.46914932131767273, 0.9989564418792725, 0.8330952525138855, 0.9412434697151184, 0.9997292160987854, 0.5237054228782654, 0.4614057242870331, 0.8807300329208374, 0.34600338339805603, 0.9807800650596619, 0.7187002301216125, 0.9408078193664551, 0.5441654324531555, 0.5949382781982422, 0.999437689781189, 0.26188719272613525, 0.8205249309539795, 0.9941703081130981, 0.9968652725219727, 0.9999883770942688, 0.9986634850502014, 0.5071538090705872, 0.5642388463020325, 0.9595913887023926, 0.3085637390613556, 0.9999092221260071, 0.5846799612045288, 0.43286481499671936, 0.730132520198822, 0.9994534254074097, 0.9987705945968628, 0.8208575248718262, 0.7343851327896118, 0.9477332234382629, 0.9868021011352539, 0.9996197819709778, 0.643292248249054, 0.3751775622367859, 0.8636715412139893, 0.9991769790649414, 0.9997808337211609, 0.9974875450134277, 0.34785497188568115, 0.5710687041282654, 0.8888117074966431, 0.5155556797981262, 0.5803002119064331], "st_polarity_prediction": "positive", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.6903321146965027}

The second sentence, while positive in sentiment, does not directly relate to GMOs and does not change the overall negative sentiment towards them in the text.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "a", "g", "mo", "'", "is", "classified", "as", "negative", "due", "to", "the", "overall", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "gen", "et", "ically", "modified", "organ", "isms", "(", "G", "MO", "s", ")", "in", "the", "text", ".", "The", "statement", "'", "most", "people", "wouldn", "'", "t", "eat", "a", "g", "mo", "'", "implies", "a", "general", "dis", "appro", "val", "or", "fear", "of", "G", "MO", "s", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "also", "supports", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "the", "first", "sentence", "express", "es", "concern", "over", "the", "manip", "ulation", "and", "explo", "itation", "of", "food", "sources", ",", "which", "can", "be", "associated", "with", "G", "MO", "s", ".", "The", "second", "sentence", ",", "while", "positive", "in", "sentiment", ",", "does", "not", "directly", "relate", "to", "G", "MO", "s", "and", "does", "not", "change", "the", "overall", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "them", "in", "the", "text", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8858840465545654, 0.8103843927383423, 0.9999952912330627, 0.6110484600067139, 0.9497273564338684, 0.9816233515739441, 0.9999234676361084, 0.9999456405639648, 0.995039165019989, 0.8371580839157104, 0.6961243152618408, 0.3365054428577423, 0.9952362179756165, 0.6026467680931091, 0.9992508888244629, 0.5630451440811157, 0.9936454892158508, 0.9975902438163757, 0.3600279688835144, 0.4734196960926056, 0.9997419118881226, 0.9197966456413269, 0.33291661739349365, 0.9998384118080139, 0.9904510974884033, 0.24470803141593933, 0.6896370649337769, 0.9057154655456543, 0.2646782696247101, 0.3887878358364105, 0.9999868869781494, 0.9999977350234985, 0.999027669429779, 0.9991666674613953, 0.9999503493309021, 0.9621064066886902, 0.9999503493309021, 0.999980092048645, 0.9976295232772827, 0.9989616274833679, 0.43013888597488403, 0.9457762241363525, 0.548333466053009, 0.5803974866867065, 0.8649747371673584, 0.14444424211978912, 0.9134573340415955, 0.9988527297973633, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9990885853767395, 0.9761344194412231, 0.9999324679374695, 0.9999870657920837, 0.9999849200248718, 0.7039459347724915, 0.9999569654464722, 0.9978740215301514, 0.47280552983283997, 0.47131481766700745, 0.3508957326412201, 0.64544677734375, 0.582128643989563, 0.9999643564224243, 0.7454529404640198, 0.6204524040222168, 0.6365682482719421, 0.5955544114112854, 0.9999939799308777, 0.9997262954711914, 0.6647579073905945, 0.5538358688354492, 0.8581316471099854, 0.9123216271400452, 0.5421102046966553, 0.4303067922592163, 0.9027248620986938, 0.9422104358673096, 0.6263419985771179, 0.7291905879974365, 0.49828872084617615, 0.9700917601585388, 0.9653650522232056, 0.9204071164131165, 0.999133288860321, 0.6137304902076721, 0.5272090435028076, 0.9836730360984802, 0.7578068375587463, 0.9999931454658508, 0.9864670038223267, 0.9990001916885376, 0.9999968409538269, 0.9998275637626648, 0.999509871006012, 0.9889528155326843, 0.8611589670181274, 0.7970898151397705, 0.2314443737268448, 0.690002977848053, 0.2859719693660736, 0.9998531937599182, 0.7809779644012451, 0.9999964237213135, 0.9632298350334167, 0.9691047072410583, 0.2878362238407135, 0.658705472946167, 0.9569457769393921, 0.9040411114692688, 0.29467853903770447, 0.7816912531852722, 0.6560686230659485, 0.8325945138931274, 0.9426305294036865, 0.9317454695701599, 0.9999696612358093, 0.8489283323287964, 0.5246163606643677, 0.9999873638153076, 0.7015919089317322, 0.9999983906745911, 0.9999961853027344, 0.6302945613861084, 0.4204818308353424, 0.9999669790267944, 0.3290039002895355, 0.9810547828674316, 0.394296258687973, 0.9104838967323303, 0.5196787118911743, 0.9741188287734985, 0.8745630979537964, 0.53993159532547, 0.8401662707328796, 0.8500499129295349, 0.9918268322944641, 0.9880680441856384], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.8103843927383423}

In a negative sense, it can refer to breaking out of confinement, such as prison, which is generally considered a harmful act. However, in a positive sense, it can mean enthusiastically participating in an activity or expressing excitement, as in 'it's time to bust out the holiday decorations'. Given the context of the provided text, 'time to bust out the tote bags', it is more likely that the term is being used in the positive sense, as toting bags is a common practice associated with shopping or attending events, and the phrase 'time to' suggests excitement or anticipation.

In this context, an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 17 is considered 'good' by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This means that the air quality is satisfactory, and the air poses little or no risk to public health. The background knowledge does not provide any information that would contradict this positive assessment. Therefore, the polarity of the target phrase 'good' is 'positive'.\n\nExplanation:\nThe term 'good' in the target phrase is a positive descriptor. It indicates that the air quality is satisfactory and poses little or no risk to public health. The background knowledge does not provide any information that would contradict this positive assessment. In fact, the second background sentence emphasizes the opportunities for growth and improvement, which is consistent with the positive sentiment associated with the term 'good' in this context.</s>",

The background knowledge indicates that the Greens are typically concerned about environmental issues, such as oil spills, which have negative impacts on the environment. The text suggests that the Greens' reaction to windmills is different, implying that they may not be as concerned about the potential negative effects of windmills. This contrast, along with the negative sentiment associated with the background knowledge regarding oil spills, suggests that the overall sentiment towards windmills in the text is likely to be negative. Therefore, the use of 'apparently' in the text is indicative of a negative sentiment.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "phrase", "'", "app", "arently", "'", "in", "the", "text", "is", "used", "to", "introduce", "a", "contrast", "between", "the", "reactions", "of", "the", "Gre", "ens", "to", "oil", "sp", "ills", "and", "their", "attitude", "towards", "wind", "m", "ills", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "indicates", "that", "the", "Gre", "ens", "are", "typically", "concerned", "about", "environmental", "issues", ",", "such", "as", "oil", "sp", "ills", ",", "which", "have", "negative", "impacts", "on", "the", "environment", ".", "The", "text", "suggests", "that", "the", "Gre", "ens", "'", "reaction", "to", "wind", "m", "ills", "is", "different", ",", "imp", "lying", "that", "they", "may", "not", "be", "as", "concerned", "about", "the", "potential", "negative", "effects", "of", "wind", "m", "ills", ".", "This", "contrast", ",", "along", "with", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "associated", "with", "the", "background", "knowledge", "regarding", "oil", "sp", "ills", ",", "suggests", "that", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "towards", "wind", "m", "ills", "in", "the", "text", "is", "likely", "to", "be", "negative", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "use", "of", "'", "app", "arently", "'", "in", "the", "text", "is", "indic", "ative", "of", "a", "negative", "sentiment", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9459168910980225, 0.4741303622722626, 0.9999986886978149, 0.6422815322875977, 0.9612471461296082, 0.9808747172355652, 0.9999252557754517, 0.9999808073043823, 0.9980731010437012, 0.8567863702774048, 0.7795912623405457, 0.23907673358917236, 0.8411573171615601, 0.9998048543930054, 0.999987006187439, 0.9983023405075073, 0.344485878944397, 0.6813139319419861, 0.5294356942176819, 0.23526859283447266, 0.4226231575012207, 0.873563289642334, 0.5263245701789856, 0.7380940318107605, 0.7861926555633545, 0.3944299519062042, 0.9273631572723389, 0.32233405113220215, 0.6337929368019104, 0.8673858642578125, 0.6191045641899109, 1.0, 0.6100143790245056, 0.9925351738929749, 0.999987006187439, 0.9999825954437256, 0.631650984287262, 0.9630542397499084, 0.36044996976852417, 0.9806140065193176, 0.9953006505966187, 0.9971829056739807, 0.9999748468399048, 0.9616690874099731, 0.7181111574172974, 0.20927169919013977, 0.919714093208313, 0.22777177393436432, 0.7531359195709229, 0.545583963394165, 0.9288666844367981, 1.0, 0.5809036493301392, 0.3708401918411255, 0.790459930896759, 0.7044302225112915, 0.6675803661346436, 0.9655516147613525, 0.5750820636749268, 0.19396886229515076, 0.9999722838401794, 0.7695818543434143, 0.9999651312828064, 0.999992311000824, 0.501173198223114, 0.5723413228988647, 0.6284950375556946, 0.9001063108444214, 0.8436746597290039, 0.7529625296592712, 0.8278941512107849, 0.9248442053794861, 0.8964828848838806, 0.439727246761322, 0.2131367325782776, 0.3531965911388397, 0.968014657497406, 0.395713210105896, 0.9591650366783142, 0.9999997019767761, 0.25354501605033875, 0.4238491654396057, 0.8964782357215881, 0.8330270051956177, 0.9837290048599243, 0.9998983144760132, 0.6533370018005371, 0.9871979355812073, 0.7717834711074829, 0.4205274283885956, 0.9999961853027344, 0.7823355197906494, 0.928942859172821, 0.49774521589279175, 0.9436209797859192, 0.4650648832321167, 0.9750808477401733, 0.9176015853881836, 0.9045026302337646, 0.7671041488647461, 0.818783164024353, 0.9665724039077759, 0.4806893467903137, 0.9615495204925537, 0.9964258670806885, 0.9927553534507751, 0.9999902844429016, 0.4285857677459717, 0.4922180473804474, 0.2585832476615906, 0.3098268210887909, 0.30169379711151123, 0.9999855160713196, 0.9991058111190796, 0.7156007289886475, 0.9740527272224426, 0.4324655532836914, 0.9999733567237854, 0.7522215843200684, 0.4830467700958252, 0.5322819352149963, 0.39146891236305237, 0.43659213185310364, 0.9999896883964539, 0.9999966025352478, 0.9673773646354675, 0.5388251543045044, 0.6602239012718201, 0.986297070980072, 0.24831704795360565, 0.9389901757240295, 0.8655565977096558, 0.6678434610366821, 0.9998853802680969, 0.9999916553497314, 0.8719524145126343, 0.7816471457481384, 0.959709107875824, 0.8347253203392029, 0.6606393456459045, 0.7424849271774292, 0.9999596476554871, 0.9942057728767395, 0.8548840284347534, 0.40161818265914917, 0.9999486207962036, 0.9491048455238342, 0.43239718675613403, 0.9999997019767761, 0.6085304021835327, 0.9999849200248718, 0.9999486207962036, 0.9999409914016724, 0.8644292950630188, 0.6316534280776978, 0.9806117415428162, 0.18556976318359375, 0.41951969265937805, 0.9999970197677612, 0.9999839067459106, 0.9756918549537659, 0.8372147083282471, 0.5387923121452332, 0.5464724898338318, 0.9474507570266724], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.4741303622722626}

However, the background knowledge can help us infer the polarity. In this case, the second background sentence, which expresses a positive sentiment towards organic farming, can be interpreted as implying a positive sentiment towards actions that contribute to the preservation of biodiversity. Planting new trees is an action that contributes to the preservation of biodiversity, and the text indicates that this activity is being supported by various organizations. Therefore, the use of the word 'support' in the text can be classified as positive.\n\nExplanation:\nThe target phrase 'support' in the text does not have a clear positive or negative sentiment on its own. However, based on the background knowledge provided, we can infer that the act of supporting the planting of new trees is a positive action. The second background sentence expresses a positive sentiment towards actions that contribute to the preservation of biodiversity, and planting new trees is an action that fits this description. Therefore, the use of the word 'support' in the text can be classified as positive.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "term", "'", "support", "'", "in", "the", "text", "does", "not", "carry", "a",

In this context, the 'rapid progress' being referred to is likely the transition to low carbon technologies. The background knowledge indicates that this transition is necessary for achieving most of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Manchin. The background knowledge suggests that there is a concern about entities and systems that prioritize power, control, and profit over the environment and people's well-being. The sentiment of the background knowledge is generally negative, and it supports the interpretation of the target phrase as negative.

In this context, it indicates that there is a problem or unwanted situation. The background knowledge does not directly relate to the target phrase, but the sentiment of the first sentence can help us understand the reason for the use of 'unfortunately'. The constant demand for resources and the high costs associated with them can indeed be a major burden, and the fact that Russia is the largest exporter of nuclear plants, which may be a costly and potentially risky energy source, adds to this burden. Therefore, the use of 'unfortunately' in this context is negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "word", "'", "un", "fortunately", "'", "is", "often", "used", "to", "express", "disappointment", "or", "regret", ".", "In", "this", "context", ",", "it", "indicates", "that", "there", "is", "a", "problem", "or", "unw", "anted", "situation", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "does", "not", "directly", "relate", "to", "the", "target", "phrase", ",", "but", "the", "sentiment", "of", "the", "first", "sentence", "can", "help", "us", "understand", "the", "reason", "for", "the", "use", "of", "'", "un", "fortunately", "'.", "The", "constant", "demand", "for", "resources", "and", "the", "high", "costs", "associated", "with", "them", "can", "indeed", "be", "a", "major", "burden", ",", "and", "the", "fact", "that", "Russia", "is", "the", "largest", "ex", "porter", "of", "nuclear", "plants", ",", "which", "may", "be", "a", "cost", "ly", "and", "potentially", "risk", "y", "energy", "source", ",", "adds", "to", "this", "burden", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "use", "of", "'", "un", "fortunately", "'", "in", "this", "context", "is", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9670541286468506, 0.3362257182598114, 0.9999960660934448, 0.5163042545318604, 0.9564776420593262, 0.9838008284568787, 0.9999238848686218, 0.9999061822891235, 0.9976890683174133, 0.832369863986969, 0.8898494839668274, 0.7558661103248596, 0.9962479472160339, 0.9996417760848999, 0.9983487725257874, 0.9996874332427979, 0.46785256266593933, 0.4242894947528839, 0.9990091323852539, 0.9924175143241882, 0.596402645111084, 0.6170529127120972, 0.6848425269126892, 0.43968552350997925, 0.6371901035308838, 0.7374352812767029, 0.8710306882858276, 0.9173893332481384, 0.9990763664245605, 0.9026402235031128, 0.288534551858902, 0.9111835360527039, 0.43225353956222534, 0.8734856247901917, 0.504601776599884, 0.5573759078979492, 0.870949923992157, 0.2316373735666275, 0.5007287263870239, 0.9855117201805115, 0.4090883135795593, 0.7057211995124817, 0.4952230751514435, 0.894519567489624, 0.4797593057155609, 0.9901145100593567, 0.261880099773407, 0.2991577684879303, 0.9999777674674988, 0.8754067420959473, 0.8649531602859497, 0.9979766011238098, 0.5674425959587097, 0.9749181270599365, 0.5178467035293579, 0.35894975066185, 0.8414445519447327, 0.8724092245101929, 0.6562201380729675, 0.8247761130332947, 0.3258102238178253, 0.37540093064308167, 0.19635091722011566, 0.9486708045005798, 0.5152168869972229, 0.3192600607872009, 0.6421974897384644, 0.807630181312561, 0.28367897868156433, 0.999984860420227, 0.7198988199234009, 0.9999681115150452, 0.9967988133430481, 0.8544317483901978, 0.7545099258422852, 0.28348907828330994, 0.9778936505317688, 0.9703191518783569, 0.9672669768333435, 0.7080224752426147, 0.7962458729743958, 0.9727084040641785, 0.997082531452179, 0.9286993145942688, 0.9996861815452576, 0.998596727848053, 0.782895565032959, 0.45427054166793823, 0.845180332660675, 0.794144332408905, 0.5672541260719299, 0.99895179271698, 0.5524612069129944, 0.5359289050102234, 0.6659358143806458, 0.7597335577011108, 0.9999082088470459, 0.9866495728492737, 0.825742244720459, 0.9859328866004944, 0.6018510460853577, 0.9995294213294983, 0.9999820590019226, 0.9989526867866516, 0.9895631670951843, 0.9982959032058716, 0.19163507223129272, 0.21926629543304443, 0.37987229228019714, 0.5068493485450745, 0.28613460063934326, 0.5805995464324951, 0.9997062683105469, 0.6417670845985413, 0.7725099921226501, 0.6966456174850464, 0.9999730587005615, 0.3989364504814148, 0.9768763780593872, 0.9915582537651062, 0.24595507979393005, 0.9964059591293335, 0.6238728165626526, 0.7722161412239075, 0.9830966591835022, 0.7033888697624207, 0.999976634979248, 0.9360357522964478, 0.7932566404342651, 0.9999902844429016, 0.8738387823104858, 0.9999783039093018, 0.9984057545661926, 0.9999951124191284, 0.6552245020866394, 0.55893874168396, 0.7223216891288757, 0.25571051239967346, 0.9216963052749634, 0.4396824538707733, 0.9729523062705994], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.3362257182598114}
