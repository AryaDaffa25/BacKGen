Therefore, the sentiment phrase \"encourage\" is neutral but the overall sentiment of the text is positive.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "enc", "our", "age", "\"", "is", "neutral", "in", "this", "context", "as", "it", "does", "not", "express", "a", "clear", "positive", "or", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "subject", ".", "The", "phrase", "is", "used", "to", "express", "the", "act", "of", "motiv", "ating", "or", "urg", "ing", "someone", "to", "do", "something", ",", "which", "can", "be", "positive", "or", "negative", "depending", "on", "the", "context", ".", "However", ",", "in", "this", "text", ",", "the", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "is", "neutral", "as", "the", "act", "of", "encouraging", "people", "to", "switch", "to", "e", "co", "-", "friendly", "products", "is", "generally", "considered", "a", "positive", "action", "towards", "sustain", "ability", "and", "reducing", "the", "impact", "on", "the", "environment", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "enc", "our", "age", "\"", "is", "neutral", "but", "the", "overall", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", "is", "positive", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.8572558760643005, 0.8232487440109253, 0.9799074530601501, 0.8094456195831299, 0.6402572393417358, 0.9997648596763611, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9999973773956299, 0.9989521503448486, 0.39308205246925354, 0.41349324584007263, 0.45834052562713623, 0.3311743438243866, 0.9525362253189087, 0.5286612510681152, 0.9513439536094666, 0.5361368656158447, 0.9998779296875, 0.2932616174221039, 0.46530935168266296, 0.5376512408256531, 0.9680653810501099, 0.9997182488441467, 0.9999899864196777, 0.6032105684280396, 0.9552631378173828, 0.8457903861999512, 0.7580803632736206, 0.4393734335899353, 0.7077831029891968, 0.25049129128456116, 0.569473385810852, 0.5747200846672058, 0.650606095790863, 0.34464946389198303, 0.5466950535774231, 0.5277264714241028, 0.9996517300605774, 0.3426421880722046, 1.0, 0.9791471362113953, 0.4916282892227173, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9381088018417358, 0.9958682656288147, 0.6999872922897339, 0.9976961612701416, 0.8417117595672607, 0.5520915985107422, 0.5308629274368286, 0.7122927308082581, 0.4794212579727173, 0.7306162714958191, 0.999944269657135, 0.997650146484375, 0.999953031539917, 0.9985997080802917, 0.953220784664154, 0.9115822911262512, 0.49916988611221313, 0.9999865889549255, 0.8495643734931946, 0.7443562150001526, 0.8519560098648071, 0.9837443828582764, 0.9690539240837097, 0.4055877923965454, 0.4094618260860443, 0.5667463541030884, 0.7209720015525818, 0.6289136409759521, 0.6506418585777283, 0.9440011382102966, 0.2982003390789032, 0.9999746680259705, 0.953851580619812, 0.32997483015060425, 0.9999765157699585, 0.9925236701965332, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9999694228172302, 0.9999990463256836, 0.9824427366256714, 0.9996061325073242, 0.9999957084655762, 0.9731037020683289, 0.8610064387321472, 0.6282927393913269, 0.80685955286026, 0.9968468546867371, 0.9714571237564087, 0.4659368395805359, 0.6389374732971191, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9922646880149841, 0.49577629566192627, 0.8623314499855042, 0.6384806632995605, 0.9272310137748718, 0.9996403455734253, 0.99979168176651, 0.9907990097999573, 0.4014154374599457, 0.9999683499336243, 0.933230996131897, 0.9517543315887451, 0.6473779082298279, 0.9683389663696289, 0.9999613761901855, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9999834299087524, 0.9999257922172546, 0.730850100517273, 0.8825582265853882, 0.5256970524787903, 0.9506744742393494, 0.9191467761993408, 0.9190754890441895, 0.9142002463340759, 0.9999086260795593, 0.9992108345031738, 0.9774609208106995, 0.9996101260185242, 0.6933139562606812, 0.8061394095420837], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.41349324584007263}

In this text, the sentiment towards the corporations causing cross contamination and burdening farmers with expensive GM seeds is negative. Therefore, the sentiment subjectivity of the sentiment phrase 'anti' in this context is negative.\n\nReason =\nThe sentiment phrase 'anti' in this text is used to express opposition to specific GMOs and corporations that are causing harm to Filipino farmers. The negative sentiment towards these corporations and their practices is evident in the text, making the sentiment subjectivity of the sentiment phrase 'anti' negative in this context.</s>",

It is used to introduce a statement that is surprising or contrary to what one might expect based on previous knowledge or assumptions. In this context, it is being used to highlight a perceived inconsistency or double standard in the actions and attitudes of environmental activists towards oil spills and windmills.

The background knowledge and examples provided do not change the classification result, as they do not directly relate to the sentiment phrase given.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "phrase", "\"", "car", "bon", "tax", "makes", "no", "sense", "\"", "is", "classified", "as", "negative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", ".", "This", "is", "because", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "express", "es", "a", "dismiss", "ive", "and", "ske", "pt", "ical", "attitude", "towards", "the", "carbon", "tax", "policy", ",", "which", "is", "often", "considered", "a", "necessary", "measure", "to", "address", "climate", "change", "and", "reduce", "carbon", "emissions", ".", "The", "negative", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "is", "consistent", "with", "the", "general", "sentiment", "of", "the", "text", ",", "which", "questions", "the", "effectiveness", "of", "carbon", "tax", "and", "express", "es", "ske", "ptic", "ism", "towards", "it", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "and", "examples", "provided", "do", "not", "change", "the", "classification", "result", ",", "as", "they", "do", "not", "directly", "relate", "to", "the", "sentiment", "phrase", "given", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9286403059959412, 0.6108906865119934, 0.9782243967056274, 0.9231029152870178, 0.7663862705230713, 0.9987711310386658, 0.9999996423721313, 0.9999951124191284, 0.9999712705612183, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9999976754188538, 0.998001754283905, 0.5677742958068848, 0.33796226978302, 0.9951735138893127, 0.6539862751960754, 0.82552570104599, 0.9885728359222412, 0.9996617436408997, 0.35317757725715637, 0.4622970223426819, 0.7859302163124084, 0.8853919506072998, 0.8850392699241638, 0.5204997658729553, 0.9722724556922913, 0.6268569827079773, 0.9996300339698792, 0.6703932285308838, 0.28794533014297485, 0.9942756295204163, 0.580805242061615, 0.5953559875488281, 0.9986934661865234, 0.9999895095825195, 0.778012216091156, 0.9626574516296387, 0.7297097444534302, 0.7380284070968628, 0.9999942183494568, 0.4932938516139984, 0.8996615409851074, 0.5062395930290222, 0.3620060384273529, 0.31833815574645996, 0.3411281704902649, 0.7455863952636719, 0.5671143531799316, 0.38951271772384644, 0.7083962559700012, 0.5733400583267212, 0.9139197468757629, 0.9999104738235474, 0.9059836864471436, 0.757303774356842, 0.8202472925186157, 0.9990147948265076, 0.9645290374755859, 0.5516279339790344, 0.5693750381469727, 0.9326213002204895, 0.5934292674064636, 0.9999831318855286, 0.3305981159210205, 0.31118395924568176, 0.9999768137931824, 0.9378940463066101, 0.21915815770626068, 0.47600021958351135, 0.20883148908615112, 0.5850034356117249, 0.9676472544670105, 0.8250765204429626, 0.9972236752510071, 0.30303043127059937, 0.9985310435295105, 0.8485575914382935, 0.7377952933311462, 0.5168472528457642, 0.696143627166748, 0.6155505776405334, 0.37727978825569153, 0.9973782896995544, 0.37739574909210205, 0.9999557733535767, 0.9999752044677734, 0.9434162378311157, 0.4780820608139038, 0.8661454319953918, 0.33293721079826355, 0.36310815811157227, 0.999822735786438, 0.6630361676216125, 0.9701497554779053, 0.8560320138931274, 0.6534984707832336, 0.9989195466041565, 0.29062479734420776, 0.7827016115188599, 0.7646425366401672, 0.9368826150894165, 0.4540662467479706, 0.9839072823524475, 0.6276907920837402, 0.6295060515403748, 0.9999943971633911, 0.6708465218544006, 0.9215807914733887, 0.9999942183494568, 0.9932386875152588, 0.9317584037780762, 0.9673836827278137, 0.5694559216499329, 0.9405391216278076, 0.9407398104667664], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.6539862751960754}
