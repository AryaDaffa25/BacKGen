Ultimately, the sentiment towards food waste itself is neutral as it is simply a fact that food waste exists and needs to be addressed.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "sentiment", "subject", "ivity", "for", "the", "given", "sentiment", "phrase", "'", "food", "w", "aste", "'", "is", "neutral", ".", "The", "text", "express", "es", "a", "call", "to", "action", "to", "reduce", "food", "waste", ",", "which", "can", "be", "seen", "as", "a", "positive", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "goal", "of", "reducing", "waste", ".", "However", ",", "the", "phrase", "'", "un", "pre", "ced", "ented", "action", "'", "implies", "a", "challenge", "or", "difficulty", "in", "achieving", "this", "goal", ",", "which", "can", "be", "seen", "as", "a", "negative", "sentiment", "towards", "the", "current", "state", "of", "affairs", ".", "Ult", "imately", ",", "the", "sentiment", "towards", "food", "waste", "itself", "is", "neutral", "as", "it", "is", "simply", "a", "fact", "that", "food", "waste", "exists", "and", "needs", "to", "be", "addressed", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.7161574363708496, 0.5944971442222595, 0.9913660287857056, 0.7330849170684814, 0.9999751448631287, 0.8822028040885925, 0.8999209403991699, 0.5549074411392212, 0.9949004650115967, 0.9998751282691956, 0.5290855169296265, 0.9996387362480164, 0.9976983070373535, 0.9999757409095764, 0.9999123215675354, 0.828112781047821, 0.782496988773346, 0.5327394604682922, 0.45895057916641235, 0.3820040822029114, 0.4421136677265167, 0.9999696612358093, 0.5554850697517395, 0.31597793102264404, 0.8086573481559753, 0.9827985167503357, 0.8446528911590576, 0.7602277994155884, 0.985013484954834, 0.9679778218269348, 0.6567602753639221, 0.4337184727191925, 0.38762956857681274, 0.9778246879577637, 0.6412045359611511, 0.9992503523826599, 0.5008012056350708, 0.940902829170227, 0.405862420797348, 0.7476659417152405, 0.5183523297309875, 0.5470677614212036, 0.722222089767456, 0.9767545461654663, 0.822074294090271, 0.5620288848876953, 0.9992127418518066, 0.999997079372406, 0.9418389201164246, 0.5728330612182617, 0.7567948698997498, 0.9885239005088806, 0.9999677538871765, 0.9999922513961792, 0.9999879002571106, 0.9999696016311646, 0.9821767807006836, 0.5400256514549255, 0.5706194639205933, 0.5728203654289246, 0.7779989242553711, 0.7914139628410339, 0.6193040609359741, 0.9962952136993408, 0.9486217498779297, 0.9997900724411011, 0.9201151728630066, 0.7416802048683167, 0.5091180205345154, 0.9917158484458923, 0.9757028818130493, 0.9999951124191284, 0.9963406920433044, 0.9982725381851196, 0.9818217754364014, 0.9928693175315857, 0.9999852180480957, 0.5700171589851379, 0.8021385073661804, 0.9956790208816528, 0.7353583574295044, 0.9584362506866455, 0.5172809958457947, 0.9999794363975525, 0.9999730587005615, 0.9968836903572083, 0.9466360211372375, 0.3979026675224304, 0.6990570425987244, 0.9576839804649353, 0.9901878237724304, 0.9578961133956909, 0.7964058518409729, 0.5197303295135498, 0.9960516691207886, 0.9701946377754211, 0.5041563510894775, 0.992292046546936, 0.397430419921875, 0.9017953872680664, 0.8744804263114929, 0.9538957476615906, 0.9504373669624329, 0.9988006353378296, 0.9378709197044373, 0.998654842376709, 0.9999997019767761, 0.9982919096946716, 0.9998391270637512, 0.9950137734413147], "st_polarity_prediction": "neutral", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.782496988773346}
