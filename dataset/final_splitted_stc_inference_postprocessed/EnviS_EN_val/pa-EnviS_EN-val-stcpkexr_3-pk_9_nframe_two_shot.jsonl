While the word itself is neutral, the context in which it is used suggests a positive meaning, as the reports are intended to cover various urban mobility, citizen, and governance issues, and contribute to the development of a climate action plan.

The sentiment of the background knowledge is also negative, further emphasizing the negative polarity of the target phrase.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "Neg", "ative", "\n", "\n", "Ex", "plan", "ation", ":", "\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "c", "ris", "is", "'", "in", "the", "text", "is", "indic", "ative", "of", "a", "negative", "situation", ".", "The", "context", "of", "the", "text", ",", "which", "ment", "ions", "a", "wind", "d", "rought", "in", "the", "UK", "causing", "an", "electricity", "crisis", "and", "forcing", "the", "government", "to", "borrow", "a", "large", "sum", "of", "money", "to", "subs", "id", "ize", "household", "bills", ",", "further", "rein", "for", "ces", "the", "negative", "sentiment", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "also", "supports", "this", "classification", ",", "as", "it", "describes", "numerous", "cr", "ises", "causing", "widespread", "harm", "and", "destruction", ",", "and", "the", "lack", "of", "action", "and", "account", "ability", "from", "those", "in", "power", "ex", "acer", "b", "ating", "the", "situation", ".", "The", "sentiment", "of", "the", "background", "knowledge", "is", "also", "negative", ",", "further", "emphas", "izing", "the", "negative", "pol", "arity", "of", "the", "target", "phrase", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9561226963996887, 0.5335958003997803, 0.9999983310699463, 0.45874276757240295, 0.7823036313056946, 0.9766544103622437, 0.9999395608901978, 0.9999926686286926, 0.9905881285667419, 0.7941668629646301, 0.8387941718101501, 0.23189687728881836, 0.9838905334472656, 0.6885597705841064, 0.999505877494812, 1.0, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9987315535545349, 0.37345924973487854, 0.9218557476997375, 0.4297226667404175, 0.4128875732421875, 0.20657788217067719, 0.9999951124191284, 0.9999482035636902, 0.9827320575714111, 0.23861366510391235, 0.9388232231140137, 0.6981086134910583, 0.6771214604377747, 0.19705063104629517, 0.4725244343280792, 0.9606552124023438, 0.6581005454063416, 0.22864530980587006, 0.8088729381561279, 0.34705793857574463, 0.9999999403953552, 0.49012911319732666, 0.7791711091995239, 0.9999735355377197, 0.9999839067459106, 0.34693071246147156, 0.9999191761016846, 0.9974554777145386, 0.5983312726020813, 0.9896500706672668, 0.9982166886329651, 0.9998838901519775, 0.6614617109298706, 0.48206621408462524, 0.9936214089393616, 0.9989938139915466, 0.9999731183052063, 0.998318076133728, 0.48947402834892273, 0.6125894784927368, 0.8512003421783447, 0.9775355458259583, 0.9999961853027344, 0.5337773561477661, 0.9931704998016357, 0.9999855756759644, 0.5580697655677795, 0.9848664402961731, 0.9997516870498657, 0.9435079097747803, 0.6095240712165833, 0.3503338694572449, 0.999996542930603, 0.9999996423721313, 0.5337198972702026, 0.9926794171333313, 0.9121672511100769, 0.5243309140205383, 0.525583028793335, 0.6689289808273315, 0.987226128578186, 0.2969917953014374, 0.1773948073387146, 0.583126425743103, 0.8083968758583069, 0.7838448286056519, 0.9335684776306152, 0.9209968447685242, 0.31145888566970825, 0.5643589496612549, 0.9680755138397217, 0.9999999403953552, 0.27870142459869385, 0.8512859344482422, 0.9984056353569031, 0.9813288450241089, 0.9172059893608093, 0.5500947833061218, 0.49189433455467224, 0.6380826830863953, 0.8333544135093689, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9713141918182373, 0.9617301821708679, 0.9998408555984497, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9957613945007324, 0.9994359612464905, 0.9999986886978149, 0.9999833703041077, 0.7776463627815247, 0.9999620914459229, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9991282820701599, 0.9659826159477234, 0.9665136337280273, 0.9988927841186523, 0.27207544445991516, 0.3080320358276367, 0.9102758169174194, 0.9898101687431335, 0.8635742664337158, 0.9470932483673096, 0.9721696376800537, 0.5996374487876892, 0.7054876089096069, 0.7469167113304138, 0.2724374234676361, 0.5038042068481445, 0.9999358057975769, 0.9109086990356445, 0.6287738680839539, 0.2929665148258209, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9719492197036743, 0.9966444373130798, 0.9285608530044556, 0.9997925162315369, 0.8945713043212891, 0.946567952632904], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.5335958003997803}

However, it is important to remember that innovation and progress do not have to come at the expense of the natural world. In fact, many countries, like India, have prioritized a green and clean environment as their first focus. This commitment is reflected in various initiatives, such as the development of dual waste collection trucks, the transformation of the UK into a climate crisis leader, and the invention of new technologies to minimize plastic waste.

In fact, the negative sentiment in the background knowledge reinforces the idea that actions that harm the environment or our health are to be avoided. The use of a cat box as a means of saving water may be seen as a desperate or extreme measure, and it is unlikely to be a sustainable or healthy long-term solution. Therefore, the target phrase is best classified as negative.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "i", "shit", "in", "a", "cat", "box", "just", "to", "save", "on", "water", "'", "can", "be", "classified", "as", "negative", ".", "The", "reason", "for", "this", "classification", "is", "that", "the", "act", "of", "def", "ec", "ating", "in", "a", "cat", "box", "is", "generally", "considered", "to", "be", "uns", "an", "itary", "and", "und", "es", "irable", ".", "The", "background", "knowledge", "does", "not", "provide", "any", "information", "that", "would", "change", "this", "assessment", ".", "In", "fact", ",", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", "rein", "for", "ces", "the", "idea", "that", "actions", "that", "harm", "the", "environment", "or", "our", "health", "are", "to", "be", "avoided", ".", "The", "use", "of", "a", "cat", "box", "as", "a", "means", "of", "saving", "water", "may", "be", "seen", "as", "a", "desperate", "or", "extreme", "measure", ",", "and", "it", "is", "unlikely", "to", "be", "a", "sustainable", "or", "healthy", "long", "-", "term", "solution", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "target", "phrase", "is", "best", "classified", "as", "negative", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9872865676879883, 0.4664439558982849, 0.6648572087287903, 0.9998552799224854, 0.6054302453994751, 0.963449239730835, 0.9996022582054138, 0.9999990463256836, 1.0, 0.9999991655349731, 0.9999970197677612, 0.9999416470527649, 0.9999992251396179, 0.9999949336051941, 0.9999948740005493, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9996097683906555, 0.4155617952346802, 0.9986101388931274, 0.8867758512496948, 0.9999165534973145, 0.497471421957016, 0.6351563930511475, 0.5541250705718994, 0.18144452571868896, 0.6232141852378845, 0.9772894978523254, 0.9359725713729858, 0.9694948196411133, 0.8341232538223267, 0.8728341460227966, 0.44923001527786255, 0.9549968242645264, 0.6249473690986633, 0.9999860525131226, 0.999946653842926, 0.9991773366928101, 0.9995198845863342, 0.9947462677955627, 0.9959660172462463, 0.4496707618236542, 0.6198607683181763, 0.8734172582626343, 0.3941557705402374, 0.9999878406524658, 0.5438193082809448, 0.9999801516532898, 0.9999778866767883, 0.8227786421775818, 0.16545462608337402, 0.9999357461929321, 0.9999451637268066, 0.48276108503341675, 0.28615036606788635, 0.2543993592262268, 0.9498122930526733, 0.4446394145488739, 0.9809265732765198, 0.6784362196922302, 0.9358661770820618, 0.4795149266719818, 0.6190681457519531, 0.7566792368888855, 0.38858261704444885, 0.8344324231147766, 0.49885106086730957, 0.7224007844924927, 0.38148266077041626, 0.9778302311897278, 0.9999991655349731, 0.8745411038398743, 0.6063950061798096, 0.8862885236740112, 0.2602759301662445, 0.9295917749404907, 0.9855291247367859, 0.9709377884864807, 0.4066408574581146, 0.9999966025352478, 0.9999996423721313, 0.7654987573623657, 0.4118867814540863, 0.9991146922111511, 0.14979836344718933, 0.8067004680633545, 0.8992903828620911, 0.9561387300491333, 0.9985474944114685, 0.871895968914032, 0.28577035665512085, 0.9494409561157227, 0.9475561380386353, 0.3483666777610779, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9913503527641296, 0.9902092218399048, 0.4221832752227783, 0.2798110842704773, 0.9999987483024597, 0.5187684297561646, 0.9983041286468506, 0.9999551177024841, 0.34074705839157104, 0.9592799544334412, 0.44416722655296326, 0.6951667666435242, 0.983753502368927, 0.9508117437362671, 0.34240955114364624, 0.8087349534034729, 0.6602410674095154, 0.9990836977958679, 0.5988291501998901, 0.7036592364311218, 0.8541110754013062, 0.3884904384613037, 0.9926416873931885, 0.919247031211853, 0.8319719433784485, 0.4657130241394043, 0.6144118309020996, 0.5900919437408447, 0.9257956743240356, 0.9904419183731079, 0.6372760534286499, 0.9389549493789673, 0.9878301620483398, 0.3686440885066986, 0.7616165280342102, 0.9999566674232483, 0.9999756813049316, 0.9999529719352722, 0.9915638566017151, 0.4193326532840729, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9710472226142883, 0.33786994218826294, 0.9998575448989868, 0.5631304979324341, 0.2970566153526306, 0.8997350335121155, 0.9999999403953552, 0.9972012042999268, 0.8007677793502808, 0.9129433035850525], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.497471421957016}

Therefore, the target phrase 'should be higher' can be classified as positive.</s>", "list_subtoken": ["\n", "The", "target", "phrase", "'", "should", "be", "higher", "'", "implies", "a", "desire", "or", "recommendation", "for", "recycl", "ing", "and", "waste", "management", "to", "have", "a", "greater", "importance", "or", "priority", "than", "climate", "change", ".", "Given", "the", "negative", "sentiment", "in", "the", "background", "knowledge", ",", "it", "is", "reasonable", "to", "assume", "that", "the", "speaker", "is", "express", "ing", "a", "concern", "that", "climate", "change", "is", "currently", "receiving", "too", "much", "attention", "at", "the", "expense", "of", "recycl", "ing", "and", "waste", "management", ".", "This", "perspective", "can", "be", "seen", "as", "a", "positive", "one", ",", "as", "it", "highlights", "the", "importance", "of", "addressing", "multiple", "environmental", "issues", ",", "rather", "than", "focusing", "solely", "on", "one", ".", "Therefore", ",", "the", "target", "phrase", "'", "should", "be", "higher", "'", "can", "be", "classified", "as", "positive", ".", "</s>"], "list_subtoken_score": [0.9546101689338684, 0.7078144550323486, 0.6497475504875183, 0.9998266696929932, 0.8956860899925232, 0.9999566674232483, 0.9999989867210388, 0.9999973177909851, 0.9974525570869446, 0.2559646666049957, 0.7004953622817993, 0.4443240761756897, 0.8249001502990723, 0.4716404676437378, 0.7553738355636597, 0.26793771982192993, 1.0, 0.9999918341636658, 0.9999987483024597, 0.9999977350234985, 0.9955407977104187, 0.5409454703330994, 0.7996190786361694, 0.6466663479804993, 0.5985286235809326, 0.5798627734184265, 0.9059787392616272, 0.45550310611724854, 0.9961250424385071, 0.9999909400939941, 0.9891853332519531, 0.4638712406158447, 0.9785003066062927, 0.7613211870193481, 0.608997106552124, 0.3643219470977783, 0.9628990292549133, 0.9601659178733826, 0.949716329574585, 0.3725822865962982, 0.6113731861114502, 0.3025479018688202, 0.3411810100078583, 0.9998295903205872, 0.7368274927139282, 0.9860730171203613, 0.81427001953125, 0.14842930436134338, 0.4363403916358948, 0.5331104397773743, 0.9999989867210388, 0.8823093771934509, 0.5938385128974915, 0.539360761642456, 0.7851300239562988, 0.9999698996543884, 0.741664707660675, 0.580019474029541, 0.6025681495666504, 0.4360053837299347, 0.9057922959327698, 0.9427803754806519, 0.34551334381103516, 0.9999995231628418, 0.9971223473548889, 0.9999992251396179, 0.5667849183082581, 1.0, 0.9999960660934448, 0.9999973177909851, 0.9999960064888, 0.9044694304466248, 0.45004695653915405, 0.38071462512016296, 0.5346158742904663, 0.9983939528465271, 0.726216197013855, 0.9993074536323547, 0.9456058740615845, 0.8896524310112, 0.2761808931827545, 0.8740948438644409, 0.9836108684539795, 0.9973926544189453, 0.46647340059280396, 0.9990041851997375, 0.9954904317855835, 0.9990957379341125, 0.7970736026763916, 0.8791357278823853, 0.9951540231704712, 0.8670847415924072, 0.36104437708854675, 0.6987550258636475, 0.9999844431877136, 0.869666337966919, 0.8825831413269043, 0.999989926815033, 0.8025462031364441, 0.7546445727348328, 0.4635394215583801, 0.9999231696128845, 0.9864794611930847, 0.4674909710884094, 0.9997262954711914, 0.5533707141876221, 0.9999895095825195, 1.0, 0.999998152256012, 0.9999217987060547, 0.7173808217048645, 0.9999855756759644, 0.9980334043502808, 0.9999979138374329, 0.520232081413269, 0.9808687567710876, 0.6365588307380676], "st_polarity_prediction": "negative", "cs_st_polarity_prediction": 0.7613211870193481}

However, it is important to remember that innovation and progress do not have to come at the expense of the natural world. In fact, many countries, like India, have prioritized a green and clean environment as their first focus. This commitment is reflected in various initiatives, such as the development of dual waste collection trucks, the transformation of the UK into a climate crisis leader, and the invention of new technologies to minimize plastic waste.

In the energy sector, renewable energy is becoming increasingly important, with safer and more efficient options gaining popularity over fossil fuels. Urban planning is another area where change is happening, with a focus on creating healthier societies through more time spent with fewer faces.

Some individuals and organizations are focusing on reducing their impact on the environment, while others are striving for greater efficiency and sustainability. For instance, Bill Gates' investments in animal agriculture and GMO cow research can be seen as a call for more productive and sustainable farming practices. Similarly, policies aimed at enhancing soil organic matter to a minimum of 3 to 6 are essential for agriculture's long-term health. In the energy sector, renewable energy is becoming increasingly important, with safer and more efficient options gaining popularity over fossil fuels. Urban planning is another area where change is happening, with a focus on creating healthier societies through more time spent with fewer faces.
